            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Ship <hi>Quedabux</hi> belonging to the <hi>Nhabob Nurulakhon</hi> in <hi>Bengala,</hi> bound from <hi>Sirian,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> towards <hi>Ballasore, William Morgan</hi> Pilot, (I <hi>Francis Davenport</hi> being then a Passenger on board the said Ship) was on Tuesday the 2d of <hi>March,</hi> 1685/6, about three Leagues to the Southward of the Land <hi>Agoada,</hi> and in sight of point <hi>Negraes,</hi> Pyratically, and without Commission attacqu'd and seiz'd by one Captain <hi>Alexander Lessly,</hi> in a Ship call'd the <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which Captain <hi>Coates</hi> had, (about three months before) as Pyratically taken from <hi>John d' Marcora,</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchant at <hi>Madapollam; Lessly</hi> being then attended with a small Sloop call'd the <hi>Malpot,</hi> and then both of them wearing the King of <hi>Syams</hi> Colours.</p>
               <p>After this seizure of the <hi>Quedabux,</hi> Captain <hi>Lessly</hi> conveyed her into the Harbour of <hi>Mergen,</hi> where the two Ships Arriv'd the 13th of <hi>March,</hi> the Sloop being in the way thither, overset by a Gust of Wind, and five men lost with her, <hi>viz.</hi> three <hi>English</hi> and two <hi>Portugueze.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> the Nocquedah and Pilot of the <hi>Quedabux,</hi> and several Passengers of us were permitted to go ashore at the Town of <hi>Mergen,</hi> and carried on our Landing (with strong Guards) directly before Mr. <hi>Samuel White,</hi> at his dwelling House: Here I found Mr. <hi>William How</hi> entertained into Mr. <hi>Samuel Whites</hi> particular service, as Steward and Cash-Keeper, who had also been carried in on Ship <hi>Mahmuddy,</hi> belonging to <hi>Meer Facqueer Deun</hi> of <hi>Metchlepatam,</hi> which had been by the said <hi>VVhite, Shabander</hi> of the Port, Condemn'd as Prize, and dispatch'd to the Coast of <hi>Choromondel,</hi> on the roaving design, under the command of Captain <hi>Edward English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I also was inform'd, that the Ship, which this day went over the Bar, and Anchor'd in seven fathom Water, belong'd to <hi>Hughly,</hi> and was Laden with twenty two Elephants bound thither, having a <hi>Portugueze</hi> Pilot. Upon this News Mounsieur <hi>Carroon,</hi> and I, addrest our selves to the <hi>Shabander,</hi> requesting his permission (since the King of <hi>Syam</hi> had no Wars with either <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> and that we were only Passengers in the Ship, now brought into that Port) to depart that Port, with that presenting opportunity of the <hi>Hughly</hi> Ship: Our business calling us to <hi>Bengala,</hi> he at first freely consented, and being made sensible that the <hi>Jerusalems</hi> Sailers, and Souldiers, had imbezelled and spent all our Provisions on board the <hi>Prize,</hi> gave order to the Purveyor to supply us a new against the next morning.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Shabander</hi> also pretended, that he would clear the <hi>Quedabux,</hi> and recruit her with Water and Plantain Trees, seeming highly to check Captain <hi>Lessly</hi> for his bringing her into Port, when he had no order for so doing; but the <hi>Nocquedah</hi> alleadging, his Ship to be in want of repairs; the Monsoon, and the long time the Elephants had been already on board; whereas had she not been intercepted, she might in all probability have been ere then at her intended Port, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could do no less, then in behalf of the Prince his Master, to protest against the said <hi>Lessly</hi> and his Abettors, for what Dammages might ensue on this interception of the Ship <hi>super Altum Mare.</hi> The <hi>Shabander,</hi> presently in a great rage, ordered her to be unladed, and all the Rubies and other Merchandize to be delivered into his own custody, turning the nine Elephants upon the <hi>Nocquedah,</hi> to be maintained at his charge, scoffingly telling him, that if he would not take the first offer of his Liberty, he should stay long enough, before he should have asecond made him,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:207011:2"/>and be taught what it was to threaten a Protest, and at length forc'd the <hi>Nocquedah</hi> to sign a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the <hi>Persian</hi> Language, signifying that the Ship was not detained by the said <hi>Shabander,</hi> but that being out of repair, and the Monsoon now far spent, the <hi>Nocquedah</hi> thought it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to proceed for <hi>Bengala,</hi> until the Months of <hi>August</hi> or <hi>November:</hi> Thus was his Ship ordered to be unrigg'd, and laid by the Walls; Mr. <hi>White</hi> not sparing to say publickly, on the <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> signing of the Paper, that the <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> next <hi>August</hi> or <hi>November,</hi> would not happen till latter <hi>Lammas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>Quedabux.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>On Munday the 15th of <hi>March,</hi> my Chest being fetcht out of the Ship, and the Provisions (according to Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> order) being put into a Boat, which was to have carried us to the <hi>Hughly</hi> Ship over the Bar, Mounsieur <hi>Carroon</hi> and my self, went to take our leaves of the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bander,</hi> who dismist us with a great deal of Courtesie; telling us, that he had sent to the Pilot of the Ship, on which we were to proceed, our late <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> Certificate for Mr. <hi>John Tyler,</hi> the King of <hi>Syam</hi>'s Agent in <hi>Bengala,</hi> to produce on any occasion of the <hi>Moors</hi> being dissatisfied at the <hi>Quedabuxes</hi> stay at <hi>Mergen,</hi> and desired, that we also would acquaint whoever enquired into it, that it was the <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> own choice, since he had been offered a speedy dispatch, if he would have proceeded.</p>
               <p>As we were putting off the shore in the Boat, the <hi>Shabander</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> sends order to stop her, and calls me to him, who (when I came to him) told me, that for some Reasons he had, he thought it not convenient, that I should go on that Ship to <hi>Bengala;</hi> At which when he saw me much surprized, and disturbed, he presently told me, he intended nothing to my prejudice, but had a mind to do me a greater kindness, than I was aware of; saying, that he would give me a good Employment in the King of <hi>Syams</hi> service, which I refusing to accept, alledging first, The unsuitableness of it to my own Inclinations, having never in my life serv'd any Heathen Prince; nextly, The inconvenience of such an engagement of my self, which perhaps might debar me the priviledge of returning home, when I should have a mind to it: And lastly, The unhandsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of taking that, or any other Employ, until I had first appeared before my late Masters, and given them an account of the loss of their Ship, besides the dissatisfaction it would be to my Friends, to have me absent, after such a cross Adventure as I had lately met with: He then told me, that if I would serve him, he would order matters so to my advantage, that I should have no occasion to repent my stay on shore, this Monsoon. That he would give me fifteen <hi>Tales per</hi> Month, to assist him in his particular affairs, and that in the Month of <hi>August</hi> next, he would put me in Master, and Supra Cargoe of a Ship of his own, which he was resolved to send to the <hi>Bay,</hi> which would be abundantly more to my Benefit, than to go now a Passenger, when I must expect to lye a whole Monsoon at home out of Employ.</p>
               <p>This fair offer prevailed with me to stay with him on shore until <hi>August</hi> next, he further add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that for the ten <hi>Tales</hi> worth of provisions, which Captain <hi>Lessly</hi> and his men had imbezelled of mine, he would see me paid; and as for what in lieu of it, he had already ordered into the Boat, the Purveyor should take it back again. So Mounsieur <hi>Carroon</hi> staying all this while in the Boat, I had only time, whilst my Chests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were fetching ashore again, to write a few Lines to Mr. <hi>Ralph Harwarr,</hi> signifying the loss of the Ship <hi>Hopewell,</hi> and the occasion of my stay here.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 16th. Instant, Mr. <hi>Samuel White</hi> the <hi>Shabander,</hi> committed to my care all his Books and Papers of Accompts, which then standing in a very confused posture, he desired me to peruse and digest them into the best and clearest method I could; saying, that he would procure a Writer under me, for Transcribing them fair over after me, in a better hand then he perceived I could write; and first to begin with the Kings Accompts, which referr'd to his oblique dis-burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the Treasury, from <hi>January,</hi> 1684/<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, for that he was ordered from Court, to remit them up to the Privy Council in <hi>July</hi> next, and therefore would have them made up to the first day of that Month, to which I gave my promise to apply my self with all possible diligence.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>This day Arrived here from <hi>Syam,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho. Yale,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Wheeler,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Kiddal,</hi> with an order from the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> to be furnished with a Ship to carry them to <hi>Madrass.</hi> The first of these was pitcht upon, as a person most proper to accompany the Jewels, which the King of <hi>Syam</hi> threw back upon his Brother the Worshipful <hi>Elihu Yale,</hi> on pretence they had been over-valued, which was done at the instance of the said Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> who was apprehensive that the Kings acceptance of them at such an over-rate, might give an opportunity to his Enemies at Court to supplant him in the Kings favour, by suggesting, that he had covertly Juggl'd with the said <hi>Yale,</hi> in thus abusing the King. The second (for want of Copper at <hi>Syam,</hi> and on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise from the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> to be the next season supply'd, with the Amount of the <hi>Phenix</hi>'s Cargoe in that <hi>specie</hi>) took his passage this way for company sake, having also orders to move the President and Council in the <hi>Jewel</hi> Affair, in case Mr. <hi>Elihu Yale</hi> did not comply with expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in taking back the Jewels, and reimbursing their Amount, as he had charg'd them to the King. The third had found so great favour with the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> as to be credited for forty <hi>Cattees,</hi> for which he brought an order to the <hi>Shabander,</hi> to pay him in Tynn at the Kings price: But the <hi>Shabander</hi> himself having occasion for the Kings Tynn, paid Captain <hi>Kiddal</hi> in ready Cash,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:207011:2"/>or at least charg'd it so in his Books, the said <hi>Kiddal</hi> being design'd from <hi>Madrass</hi> to the <hi>Bay,</hi> to fetch his Wife to <hi>Syam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this their Arrival at <hi>Mergen,</hi> the <hi>Dorothy</hi>'s design for <hi>Atcheen</hi> was laid aside, and her Cargoe of Rice being sold to Mr <hi>Thomas Yale</hi> (not without the disgust of Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi>) she was pitcht upon to carry them to <hi>Madrass.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Wednesday</hi> the 17th. Captain <hi>John Coats</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Mergen,</hi> from the Coast of <hi>Chormondel,</hi> in a small Sloop call'd the <hi>Robin,</hi> which he had built at <hi>Madapollam,</hi> and brought with him about Forty <hi>Europeans,</hi> who were full with boastings of the great Exploits which <hi>Coats</hi> had done against the Subjects of the King of <hi>Golcondah,</hi> whom they in Bravado stil'd the Enemy, and particularly in taking a Fort at <hi>Madapollam,</hi> and firing of <hi>Metchlepatam:</hi> But notwithstanding all this, 'twas easie enough to observe, that <hi>Coat</hi>'s Reception by the <hi>Shabander,</hi> did not correspond with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, though (because of these Strangers) the best side was put outermost on both hands.</p>
               <p>On the 18th. arriv'd from the Coast of <hi>Chormondell</hi> a Ship call'd the <hi>Tokely,</hi> belonging to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Sadock</hi> of this Port, a Moor, and Son to the late <hi>Shabander;</hi> her Lading consisted chiefly of Salt for Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and the Ship he immediately seiz'd to himself, for security and satisfaction of a Debt which the said <hi>Sadock</hi> ow'd him.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the 20th. The <hi>Dorothy</hi> (Captain <hi>John Croply</hi> Commander) was dispatcht to carry Mr. <hi>Yale, &amp;c.</hi> with the Jewels to <hi>Madrass.</hi> The <hi>Shabander,</hi> Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> and my self accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying them on board the Ship down the River, and <hi>Coats</hi> Sloop following the Ship to take us in when we parted from them.</p>
               <p>On our return towards the Town in the Sloop, Mr. <hi>White</hi> began to tax Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> with his indiscreet management of Affairs at the <hi>Coast;</hi> telling him, that he must prepare to go to <hi>Syam,</hi> and there give an Account to the King of what he had done, and particularly blam'd him for the Re-delivery of <hi>John d' Marcoraes</hi> Money, and bringing away an empty ship, and leaving <hi>Don Joseph d' Haeredia</hi> behind him upon the Coast, as well as surrendering the King of <hi>Golcondah</hi>'s Ship: <hi>Coats</hi> pleaded the good Service he had done Mr. <hi>White,</hi> in revenging him on <hi>Ally Beague</hi> the <hi>Hoble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> of <hi>Metchlepatam,</hi> by putting the Country into a Combustion, which he had done in observance to Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> private Orders to him; contrary to the express command of the King their Master, and that instead of being blam'd, he expected the <hi>Shabander</hi> should according to his promise, skreen him from His Majesties displeasure, he having expos'd himself meerly to it for his sake, when they came on shore, they came to so high words, that <hi>Coats</hi> in a great passion openly slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Shabander,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> and privately ordering his Chyrurgeon to bring him an Ounce of <hi>Opium,</hi> pretended in sight of us to swallow a large Pill, which stepping into the next room he brought out in his hand, heaving the remaining <hi>Opium</hi> publickly out of the Window, after he had first shown it to Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and told him that his unhandsomness had made him take that Pill, which (as he said) was a parcel of the <hi>Opium,</hi> nor did he cease after this action extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly to rail against them both. Mr. <hi>White</hi> doubting he had desperately poysoned himself, seem'd mightily troubled at it, and sent for the Garrison Chirurgeons, (both <hi>Frenchmen</hi>) who both came and gave their opinions, that Captain <hi>Coats</hi> had not swallow'd any Poyson, though his own Chirurgeon affirm'd, that what he brought was <hi>Opium,</hi> which in observance of his command he had innocently done, not knowing what occasion this Captain design'd it for, however Mr. <hi>VVhite</hi> for that time humor'd Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> by courting a Reconciliation, and pretending that he would engage Life for Life, that if Captain <hi>Coats</hi> would but go up to <hi>Syam,</hi> he would bring about so, as that all his proceedings should meet with his Majesties approbation, and he not want all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Honour he could desire. <hi>Coats</hi> now seem'd better satisfy'd, was prevail'd with to take (as the Doctors call'd them) needless Antidotes to expel the fancy'd Poyson, and next morning was well recover'd from a feigned Indisposition.</p>
               <p>They are after this Nights Comical Feat, fast friends to all appearance, and harp no more on the Coast Exploits, only Captain <hi>Coats</hi> the next day begins to make up his private Accounts with Mr. <hi>VVhite,</hi> concerning a parcel of Raw Silk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he had in his own name formerly consign'd from the Coast to Mr. <hi>VVhite,</hi> and then prepares for his Journey to <hi>Syam,</hi> and delivers me all his Papers and Journal, relating to his <hi>Coast</hi> Expedition, to be registred for the <hi>Shabander,</hi> amongst which the most considerable, and likely to tend to his, or the <hi>Shabanders</hi> prejudice, was the protest which Mr. <hi>Freeman,</hi> Mr. <hi>VVales, &amp;c.</hi> had made against him; Mr. <hi>Mallet,</hi> and <hi>Don Joseph d' Haeredia,</hi> in hehalf of the Honourable <hi>East-India</hi> Company, for dammages sustained by his Hostile proceedings at <hi>Madapollam,</hi> and some Letters, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Chief at <hi>Metchlepatam, Laurence Pit</hi> had sent him, wherein he also complained of great dammage, and threatned to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it in a proper season, together with several Letters from Mr. <hi>Freeman,</hi> the final answer of which was, <hi>Coats</hi> Surrender of the King of <hi>Golcondahs</hi> own Ship, when at the same time, he detain'd the Ship of a Merchant stranger, who was no Subject to that King, with whom he pretended the King of <hi>Syam</hi> his Master to have War.</p>
               <p>This accidental and strange difference between these two persons, made me somewhat curious in my enquiries and search into the reason, and first commencement of this, which by what I could collect from all the Letters and other Writings, which had past between Mr. (alias Lord) <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> Mr. <hi>VVhite,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coates</hi> was this.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>VVhite</hi> being in a Ship of the King of <hi>Syams</hi> at <hi>Metchlepatam,</hi> had received (by the private instigation of Mr. <hi>Robert Freeman</hi> as he fancy'd) some abuses, and sustain'd some loss by <hi>Ally Beague</hi> the <hi>Hobledar,</hi> to the amount 1200 <hi>Pagodoes,</hi> and afterwards his Ship <hi>Spellman</hi> being deny'd at the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:207011:3"/>same Port a supply of <hi>Cables,</hi> was for want of them cast away upon the <hi>Coast,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> being then arriv'd to the <hi>Shabandership</hi> of <hi>Tenassery,</hi> by the Interest of the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> sues for Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Reprizal from his Master the King: The Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> so represents matters to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that he consents to make open War with the King of <hi>Golchondah,</hi> but first for fashion sake, resolves to demand satisfaction for several affronts, done by the Subjects of that King to his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown and Dignity; the <hi>Ribarr</hi> employ'd to demand redress at the Court of <hi>Golcondah</hi> failes in his Duty, or at least in their expectation; <hi>Coates</hi> is thereupon ordered to begin the War, and is furnished with Copper, and other Goods to defray his necessary expence, and entertainment of all the <hi>Englishmen</hi> he could get into the service for that design, and is in <hi>March,</hi> 1681/5. dispatcht from <hi>Mergen</hi> to <hi>Madrass,</hi> counsign'd to Mr. <hi>Thomas I<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>April</hi> following, comes from Court a Revocation of <hi>Coates's</hi> Commission, with strict Orders to forbid his breaking into a War with the King of <hi>Golcondah,</hi> or using any act of Hostility or molestation, towards any of his Subjects, with positive command to Mr. <hi>White,</hi> immediately to dispatch the best Sailer belonging to the Port with that Express, so that it might reach <hi>Coates</hi> at <hi>Madrass:</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> could not avoid sending it, but withal sends his own private Orders to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Coastes,</hi> to proceed according to his former Instructions, promising to stand between him and all danger, and reflecting highly upon the sickleness, and irresolution of the <hi>Syam</hi> Courtiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coates</hi> having advice at <hi>Trincombarr</hi> of <hi>Ivatt</hi>'s Death, flusht with money, and blown with Ambition, is prepar'd for any undertaking for his great Friend Mr. <hi>White;</hi> and when <hi>Cropley</hi> brings him the Letters to <hi>Madrass,</hi> prefers Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Orders to those of the King his master, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly under pretence of going to look for <hi>Don Joseph,</hi> and having a leaky Vessel under him, puts into <hi>Madapollam,</hi> rebuilds his old Vessel, and builds two small ones more, and now having lived at an extravagant rate, and by his careless lavishness made all <hi>Sterling,</hi> as we say, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to fetch it up again, by the seizure of an <hi>Armenians</hi> Ship, which had (by report) near 60000 <hi>Pagadoes</hi> in her bound to <hi>Madrass;</hi> Now is the Country Alarm'd, and <hi>Coates</hi> inveigling <hi>Don Joseph d' Haeredia</hi> to side with him, open defiance is proclaim'd: Many of the poor <hi>Paddy Boats</hi> taken, Robb'd and destroy'd, a small inconsiderable Fort below <hi>Nassapore</hi> taken and sack't, and the Guns brought away, <hi>Metchlapatam</hi> skulkingly set on fire, the Companies Goods stop'd in the Countrey (or alledg'd to be) because all this was done by <hi>Englishmen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Freeman</hi> appears in behalf both of the Company, the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and himself, and at length makes an advantage of <hi>Coates</hi> weakness, according to the <hi>Mergen</hi> construction of the matter.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things were thus carried at the Coast, Mr. <hi>White</hi> himself had an opportunity put into his hands, to break with the <hi>Moors,</hi> which he was resolved not to lose, not knowing how <hi>Coats</hi> might succeed in his designs; and 'twas thus. <hi>Cropley</hi> returning in the <hi>Dorothy</hi> from <hi>Coats,</hi> finds at Anchor under <hi>Ilha Ferro,</hi> a Ship belonging to the <hi>Nhabob Mahomet Aminkhon,</hi> Laden with <hi>Metchlepatam</hi> Goods, and waiting for fair Weather to put into <hi>Mergen,</hi> whither she was bound; he coming in before her, tells the <hi>Shabander;</hi> who immediately sends <hi>Croply</hi> out again, with orders to attacque, seize, and bring her into Port as a Prize: He follow'd his orders; Mr. <hi>White</hi> gives notices of what he had done to the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> he construing it (according to Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> plausible representation of the matter) as an omen of future good success, commends the Act, and prevails with the King to approve it: Now no longer peace with <hi>Golcondah,</hi> another <hi>Gingerlee</hi> Ship being in Port, is detained and confiscated with her Cargoe. The <hi>Shabander</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises the Court, that many Coast Ships frequented <hi>Pegu:</hi> The Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> encourages him to way-lay them all, and bring them into <hi>Mergen</hi> for Examination; so that this year no less then seven Sail have been taken and Prized, and several others paid sawce for their being cleared, only the <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> with her Cargoe, belonging to Mr. <hi>Freeman,</hi> and his effects on broad the <hi>Momuddy</hi> escap't; which was done for Reasons no less publick then politick.</p>
               <p>Of the number of those taken was a Ship called the <hi>Sta Cruz,</hi> Burthen about 350 Tons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Joseph,</hi> Brother to <hi>John d' Marcora,</hi> who little deserved such usage, as not only being no Subject to the King of <hi>Golcondah,</hi> but being the Redeemer of many poor <hi>English</hi> Men, and others, at his vast charge, out of Captivity in <hi>Pegu.</hi> His Ship, without ever preadvising up to Court, was sent with her Cargoe to <hi>Atcheen;</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> at one and the same time seizing all, and yet promising to interceed for the restitution of both Ship and Cargoe to him; however he and his Son (being by Mr. <hi>White</hi> detain'd behind, as pledges for the Ships return; for Mr. <hi>White</hi> was fearful, least the men he had sent upon her should be either over-power'd, or over perswaded to let her escape at <hi>Atcheen</hi>) did at length, with much importunity, obtain liberty to go in Person to Court, being full of hopes, that the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> would be so just, as to take the Case into consideration, and move the King in his favour. This <hi>Nocquedah</hi> having been inform'd that I came out of <hi>England</hi> in the same Ship with Mr. <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> willing to leave no means unessay'd, desired me to write to him in his behalf, which I (not daring to deny any thing, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of my power, to one whom I owed my Redemption from Slavery) accordingly writ, and gave him this following Letter to the Lord <hi>Phaulkon.</hi>

               <p>The beginning of this Month Arrived the <hi>Delight, Robert Mellish</hi> Master, from <hi>Madrass,</hi> with a Cargoe of Cloth, to the amount of six thousand Pagodoes and upwards, in Joynt-stock, between Mr. <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> and Mr. <hi>Samuel White,</hi> the two Owners of the said Ship, in equal proportion, she is sent up with her Lading to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> for the conveniency of Repacking it into Bales, fit for Transport to <hi>Syam,</hi> whither it was to be sent, committed to the care of Mr. <hi>Francis Heath</hi> for Sale.</p>
               <p>The 9th of this Month also Arrived the <hi>Agent</hi> from <hi>Bengala,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Thredder</hi> Cape Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, her Cargoe consisting of Butter, Oyl, Salt, Dammer, Cloth and Raw Silk, in Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, between Mr. <hi>John Tyler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitz Needham</hi> and himself; a part of her and the Cargoe, was by them offered to Sale to the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> and Mr. <hi>White,</hi> which latter did at first accept of an eighth at the Price proposed, but in a few days, on second thoughts, recanting; he also wrote up to <hi>Syam,</hi> disswading the former from being concern'd; however he took off all the Butter, Oyl, Salt and Dammer, which were on good Demand, at a very low Price, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to sell it to any of the Merchants, who would have given a far greater rate, and left him at liberty to prceed for <hi>Syam</hi> with his Raw Silk and Cloth, fairly promising that (in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hard measure Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> complained of, in not being permitted to sell his Butter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the best advantage) he would in absence furnish the Skipper, <hi>John Bunt,</hi> with Carpenters Timber Plank, or whatsoever else he should want for the fitting his Ship.</p>
               <p>About the middle of this Month we went up to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> where the <hi>Delights</hi> Cargoe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and repackt, and to it was added a quantity of <hi>Metchlepatam</hi> Goods, to the amount of fourty Cattees, being a parcel of <hi>Mahomet Aminkhons</hi> Cargoe, which Mr. <hi>White</hi> found a knack to make clear gains to himself, in disposing at the same time another quantity of the said Cargoe to the amount (as he forc'd the Merchant to take them off) of two hundred Cattees, which very parcel of the said Cargoe he had newly received express order from <hi>Syam</hi> to remit to <hi>Clong:</hi> Nay there those Goods being much wanted, and on great demands there; but because by that means he would have lost the opportunity of a snack out of them, he thinks best to pretend the Kings stock of Cash then in his hands to be low, and the Garrison and Port charges being to be defray'd before the close of his Books, he adventured the breach of order, and exposed them to Sale as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Coates</hi> took his journey hence for <hi>Syam</hi> the 22th of this Month, and the day before his departure, perceiving him to be very melancholly, I askt him what made him so, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon taking me into a private Room, he produc'd a Paper, which he bad me read; and I found it to be Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> forementioned order to him, encouraging him (notwithstanding the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition) to make War upon <hi>Golcondah,</hi> by doing what mischief he could at <hi>Metchlepatam,</hi> or any Ships belonging to that Port, or any part of that Kings Dominions, and assuring him, that he would not only bear him out, but make it redound to his great advantage and honour at the Court of <hi>Syam.</hi> When I had read it Captain <hi>Coats</hi> asked me, whether Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> demeanour to him, since his Arrival at <hi>Mergen,</hi> had corresponded with those splendid Promises he had made him in that Paper, and whether 'twas reasonable that he should be turn'd over to <hi>Syam,</hi> to give an account of his proceedings at the Coast; when Mr. <hi>White</hi> was the only person that put him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:207011:4"/>Action, and for whose sake alone he had thus embroil'd himself? To which I reply'd, my opinion was, that the exhausting so much of the Kings stock by his twelve months stay at the Coast, without any advantage, was the main reason that made Mr. <hi>White</hi> loth to pass his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; but that however, Mr. <hi>White</hi> being very sensible that those orders may at any time be produc'd against him, there was no question but he would use his utmost endeavours to obviate all the blame that the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> could transfer upon Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> except in the case of his surrender of <hi>John d' Marcordes</hi> Treasure, and the King of <hi>Golcondahs</hi> Ship, and buying of the <hi>Danesburg</hi> without order; to all which Captain <hi>Coats</hi> replyed, he could readily answer and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, and that nothing troubled him, but that his first commencement of the breach at the Coast, being point blank contrary to the King of <hi>Syams</hi> express pleasure, he should now appear to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the private Revenge and Interest of his Friend, before his Duty to his great Master, and that he saw no way to save himself, but by letting the King understand the truth of the matter, which could not but be of hazardous consequence to Mr. <hi>White, Coats</hi> being only at first Commissionated to follow such Instructions from time to time, as he should receive from the <hi>Shabander,</hi> which Commission also he now shew'd me, together with the revocation, and strict prohibition to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest or disturb, or use any hostile action towards any of the Subjects of the King of <hi>Golcondah,</hi> but to return with all possible speed through the streights of <hi>Malacca</hi> to <hi>Syam,</hi> with all the <hi>English</hi> men he could possibly procure, and bring <hi>Don Joseph</hi> in his Company, the King resolving to War upon <hi>Cambodia;</hi> to which I had little to say, only advised Mr. <hi>Coats</hi> to be of good Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and yet very cautious how he prejudiced his old and experienced Friend, telling him, I doubted not, but on his Arrival at <hi>Syam,</hi> his own ingenuity would suggest to him the most suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and safe methods of proceeding.</p>
               <p>This month also arrived <hi>Don Joseph d' Haeredia,</hi> in a new ship of his own, called the <hi>Sancta Rosa,</hi> Burthen about four hundred Tons, from the Coast; with a parcel of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> Souldiers, whom he had encouraged to come over into the King of <hi>Syams</hi> service, and forty five Prisoners taken by <hi>Coats</hi> and him out of the Paddy Boats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they plunder'd or destroyed on the Coast. Many dayes had not past before Mr. <hi>White</hi> and the <hi>Don</hi> fell at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; though the latter managed matters so subtilly, by a seeming condescension, that it broke not into open flame, be yielding to surrender his Account at <hi>Syam,</hi> which the <hi>Shabander</hi> refused to accept, or examine here, which yet the <hi>Don</hi> thought but reasonable he should have done. The Case was thus:</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Coats</hi>'s Vessel, with which he went from <hi>Mergen</hi> the last year, being too small to carry all the effects, assign'd by the King for his Coast Expedition; <hi>Don Joseph</hi> makes voluntary offer of his old Ship to serve the King on that occasion, and carry the remaining part of the Goods after <hi>Coats</hi> to <hi>Madrass;</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> accepts the motion, and Lades on him in <hi>March,</hi> 1684/5, the remaining quantity of Copper, Tynn, and Tutenage, with a parcel of Elephants, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches him for that Port; he meeting with contrary Winds, puts in to <hi>Metchlepatam,</hi> and the most of his Elephants being dead by the way, the rest he Lands there, of which (after a great charge in keeping them) only two were sold; the others also dying before he could meet with a Market for them, <hi>Ally Beague,</hi> by a Wile, gets into his clutches Goods, to the amount of three thousand <hi>Pagodoes,</hi> and detains them as the King of <hi>Syams;</hi> Mr. <hi>Freeman,</hi> with some difficulty, recovers from the <hi>Don</hi> to the amount of two thousand two hundred eighty nine <hi>Pagodoes</hi> for Mr. <hi>Lucas,</hi> on account of Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> who had also shipt Goods on him for his own account: The <hi>Dons</hi> old Ship proves unserviceable, he removes her to <hi>Madapollam,</hi> and sets a new one upon the Stocks, designing her (as <hi>Lessly</hi> reported) for the <hi>Persia</hi> Trade, in Mr. <hi>Freemans</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy: <hi>Coats</hi> in the mean time Arrives there, puts him by that design, and draws him into the intriegue, to joyn with him in the projected disturbance, himself had resolved, pursuant to Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> aforesaid orders, to break out into. The Government jealous of their designs, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to interrupt their Building of their Vessels. The <hi>Don</hi> entertains several Souldiers as the King of <hi>Syams</hi> servants; they then both stand upon their Guards, and with much difficulty at length, get their Vessels into the Water, only Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> in a bravado, burnt his old Vessel upon the Stocks, having then thrown away (as <hi>per</hi> his account) thirty <hi>Cattees</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building her; the Factory for shewing them no other then ordinary Civility is embroiled and hazarded; the Companies Interest suffers; and at length <hi>Don Joseph,</hi> having by the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of maintaining so many Souldiers and Lascars, and the supplies he had afforded Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> with what <hi>Ally Beague</hi> detained from him, drain'd his Purse of all the Kings Cash, and was the proceed of what he carried with him; highly opposed Captain <hi>Coats</hi> in the surrender of the King of <hi>Golcondahs</hi> Ship to Mr. <hi>Freeman,</hi> expecting by detaining her, to bring <hi>Ally Beague</hi> to a complyance and redelivery of what he had sequestred from him: But in the end, <hi>Coats</hi> over-ruling him, the Ship is delivered back; <hi>Coats</hi> leaves the Coast, and not long after, <hi>Don Joseph</hi> leaves <hi>Metchlepatam</hi> Road, being threatned by a <hi>Dutch</hi> man that Rode there, goes down to <hi>Corrango</hi> to water, and there meets with opposition; thence he sails to <hi>Vizagapatam,</hi> there gets some recruit, and so comes to <hi>Mergen,</hi> where Mr. <hi>White</hi> not willing to pass such Account as he thought would not prove satisfactory at Court; and having an Eye upon the <hi>Dons</hi> Ship, if possible to hook her to himself, referr'd him thither: The <hi>Don</hi> at first refused it, alleadging that being employed by the <hi>Shabander,</hi> he was to give his accounts to the <hi>Shabander,</hi> and to no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son else; but at length, upon Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> large promises of appearing in his behalf to the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> so effectually, that the <hi>Don</hi> might be assured of not only a currant acceptance of his

               <p>Here also before our return to <hi>Mergen,</hi> the <hi>Shabander</hi> ordered the bringing into him of all the Rents, Penalties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had been by the under Officers of the <hi>Clong,</hi> Collected this Year; so that his stock was once more considerably recruited to the amount of 506 <hi>Cattees,</hi> and leaving Mr. <hi>Heath</hi> to proceed the next day with the <hi>Delights</hi> Cargoe, the <hi>Metchlepatam</hi> Goods, and twelve Pattararaes of <hi>Ophium</hi> consign'd to Mr. <hi>White,</hi> from Dr. <hi>Ralph Harwar:</hi> We this Evening left <hi>Tenassery</hi> to return to <hi>Mergen.</hi>

               <p>The height of business being now over, Mr. <hi>White</hi> dedicated this Month to his divertisement and recreation, and begun with a design to sound round all the Islands near this Port, and take notice of all the Channels leading to it, for which end he took me with him in the Sloop <hi>Robin,</hi> being attended by the small Sloop called the <hi>Mary,</hi> both which Captain <hi>Coats</hi> had built at <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollam;</hi> but when we came out to the Westward of the Islands, we soon found the Year was too far spent for such an undertaking. The Weather not permitting our stay abroad, he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to stand in again amongst the Islands, and take the pleasure of Fishing, dispatching a Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to <hi>Mergen</hi> to fetch down the Fishermen and their Nets: When five or six dayes had past with this pleasant divertisement, an unlookt for and unwelcome summons for Mr. <hi>White,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to repair to the Court at <hi>Levo,</hi> dampt all our Jollity; now was it become but good manners to conform our selves to his more reserved and melancholly deportment, and <hi>Regis ad Exemplum,</hi> nothing but silence among us. To <hi>Mergen</hi> we return, where he begins to frame an Apology for his non-complyance with the Summons, alleadging not only his indisposition and want of Health, but the prejudice that would accrue to his Majesties Affairs, if he was forc'd by so sudden a removal to leave them in that unsetled posture they yet were in; but two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, before he had dispatcht that Letter, comes another Pursuivant to call him up, and in two days more a third, with an Express, to hasten him up by night or day. Upon which, a Letter is dispatcht to my Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> of a quite different Tenor, to what was at first prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, signifying his willingness to come up to Court to take new measures for the business of the ensuing Year, which the present state of Affairs rendred necessary; and nothing but his late being abroad to survey the Frontiers had kept him so long from moving his Honour for liberty to come and kiss his Hand; now all preparation is made for our Journey, the Souldiers and Seamen all paid off, and (which was a trick I had never heard of before) because Mr. <hi>White</hi> would not appear to be in the Kings Debt, he invented a Muster Role of so many mens names (who for ought any man knows never were in <hi>rerum Natura</hi>) as swept out of the Kings stock 135 <hi>Cattees,</hi> as clearly as if they had been lain on a Drum-head in the face of a Regiment, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it might be as troublesome to him to have any of the Kings Stores, as well as Cash in his hands, he resolves to make a Ballance of the <hi>Clongs</hi> Account, by reparting all the remains (the amount whereof <hi>per</hi> Invoice was 276 <hi>Cattees</hi>) into separate charges, as already disbursed and distributed upon all the Kings Ships, and accordingly the Kings Godowns were clean swept, and the <hi>Shabanders</hi> fill'd: Thus was I ordered to close the Kings Books in Duplicates, from <hi>January</hi> 1684/5 to the 1st of <hi>July</hi> next, he making the Kings stock at <hi>Mergen</hi> vanish in a moment: His publick Table now broke off: His Goods and Houshold Utensils all Inventoried; and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his House recommended to Mr. <hi>Hows</hi> care, with private Letters and Instructions left for all the Commanders of Ships belonging to the Port, that might be expected to arrive, during his absence. Now also is the difference and fewd, which for four Months together (because
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:207011:5"/>the man had a mind to have shared stakes with Mr. <hi>White</hi> in the Prize profits) had been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between himself and Mr. <hi>Burneby,</hi> with great animosity on Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> part totally (at least seemingly) laid aside, and Mr. <hi>Burneby</hi> much courted by him, and pitcht upon to act as his Attorney, to receive and open all his Letters, and take into his possession at present his Plate, Jewels, and a small Box with Rubies; and hereafter whatsoever Goods should be Imported, either for his proper Account, or on Consignment, only what Gold was expected from <hi>Atcheen,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Triggs,</hi> being the process of the <hi>Success</hi> her Cargoe, and the <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the <hi>Armenian</hi>) was to be paid into Mr. <hi>Mellish,</hi> he passing his receipt for the same to <hi>Tho. Triggs</hi> for Account of Mr. <hi>White;</hi> to him also Mr. <hi>White</hi> now delivered a parcel of Gold, to answer part of the <hi>Delights</hi> Cargoe, designing, however squares might go with himself, that Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi> should be no sufferer.</p>
               <p>Things being thus setled at <hi>Mergen,</hi> on the 20th of <hi>May</hi> we began our Journey; at <hi>Tenassery</hi> we met a fourth Messenger, and thence proceeded in all hast to <hi>Jelinga;</hi> there he, Captain <hi>Lessly</hi> and my self, took our speediest way by Land; they two with <hi>Doolies,</hi> my self, with an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, leaving Mr. <hi>John Turner,</hi> his Writer, and Mr. <hi>Ware,</hi> with several of his black servants, to come after us with the Baggage and Carts.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Peranne</hi> we met with two other <hi>Bragos Pintados,</hi> or Pursuivants, to hasten him up to Court, wheresoever they should meet with him: This hurrying of those Messengers at the heels one of another, gave Mr. <hi>White</hi> no small jealousie, that all was not well; however there was now no remedy, but go he must; so here we immediately take Boat, and go by Sea to <hi>Syam</hi> River, Mr. <hi>White</hi> (now wishing himself no <hi>Shabander</hi>) in the interim composed himself to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and ordered me to Pen down what he could conceive might have slipt him, that would be likely to prove matter of offence to the King, or the Lord <hi>Phaulkon;</hi> the heaviest charges, and those which he ordered me to write for his own review, saying, that he expected no worse, were,
<list>
                     <item>I. His dispatch of the <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> with her Lading to <hi>Atcheen,</hi> after her seizure upon his own head, without waiting an Order from Court, for either her seizure or dispatch.</item>
                     <item>II. His dismission of <hi>Arnold Baroons</hi> and <hi>Nelcons</hi> Ships, who both had in them Subjects and Goods of the King of <hi>Pegues,</hi> without advising up to Court.</item>
                     <item>III. His forcing from the Merchants, (for he thought, he said, they would call it so) on the two aforesaid Ships for their dismission, to the amount of five thousand and odd <hi>Pagodoes,</hi> of which he had never advised the truth to Court, nor brought it into the Treasury; he only hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Lordship, that the said Ships belonged to, and the said Merchants, were inhabitants of <hi>Madrass,</hi> and therefore in respect to the amicable Correspondence, which hitherto had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served unviolated, between the Honourable <hi>English</hi> Company, and the Crown of <hi>Syam,</hi> he had after strict Examination clear'd them; and they at their departure freely made him a small Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which for its inconsiderableness, he hop't might pass as a perquisite to his Office.</item>
                     <item>IV. His Sale of <hi>Mahomet Aminkhons</hi> remaining part of the Cargoe, contrary to order, it being expresly sent for up to <hi>Syam.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>V. His engrossing all Goods Imported into his own hands, by which means, not only all other Merchants, but even the King himself had been forc't to take of him, and at his price.</item>
                     <item>VI. His neglect in Fortifying the Town of <hi>Mergen,</hi> which he had represented up to Court, to be rendered impregnally Fortified by his own great pains, and at the Kings vast charge, which he said he was jealous, or the Country people, or the <hi>Moors,</hi> (his mortal enemies) might have given a truer account of, than he had done.</item>
                     <item>VII. His detaining to his own use a parcel of choice Rubies, taken out of the <hi>Pegu</hi> Ships, to the amount of 130 <hi>Cattees,</hi> of which his own <hi>Oconta</hi> being privy to the act, he was jealous that information might have been given by him.</item>
                     <item>VIII. His dispatch of the Sloop <hi>Phaulkon</hi> in <hi>March</hi> last to <hi>Atcheen,</hi> without orders from Court, which he said, might perhaps prove as hard to answer, as the dispatch of the <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> thither, whose motion the former was sent to attend, and Convoy her back to <hi>Mergen;</hi> and if neither of them should return safe back, he lay liable to a double Lash: That is, to satisfie the King and the <hi>Armenian.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>IX. His detaining of the proceed of the <hi>Derrea Dowlets</hi> Cargoe, her last Voyage to <hi>Atcheen,</hi> contrary to the Kings Orders, on pretence that he wanted it, to defray the charges of the Port and Shipping.</item>
                     <item>X. His detaining likewise part of the proceed of the <hi>Nonkalays</hi> Cargoe.</item>
                     <item>XI. His difference with Mr. <hi>Burneby,</hi> which had grown to that height, that the Country people, he doubted, took great notice of it, and his acting all the preceding year on his own head, both in issuing out Orders, Instructions and Dispatches to the Commanders of the Kings Ships, and condemning or clearing what, and whomsoever he thought best, without either advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the <hi>Oyea</hi> and <hi>Coromocon,</hi> or permitting Mr. <hi>Burneby</hi> to be privy to any thing he did in the Kings Affairs, or so much as Communicating to him those Letters, which always came Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally directed to them joyntly from Court.</item>
                     <item>XII. And Lastly, (which he said he accounted the deepest and most unanswerable charge they could lay against him, and he was afraid <hi>Coats</hi> had produced them) his Orders to Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> for commencing a War with <hi>Metchlepatam,</hi> flatly contrary to the Kings express Command.</item>

               <p> Thus was the remaining part of our passage spent by him in forming fit Answers for what he had recollected, as most likely to be alleadged against him, and being from hence forward more then ordinarily dejected in his Spirits; the day before we got up to the City, he was taken with a strong Feaver.</p>

               <p>The first of this Month we Arrived at <hi>Syam,</hi> about six in the Evening; the next day Mr. <hi>White</hi> receiving from <hi>John Mattheos</hi> and <hi>Anthony Perez,</hi> to the amount of about sixty <hi>Cattees,</hi> for Goods sent up by them in <hi>January</hi> last for Sale here, and a parcel of China Ware and other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which they had invested according to his order, deliver'd all, both the Money and Goods into Mr. <hi>Francis Healths</hi> possession, and ordering me to stay at the City, until Mr. <hi>Turners</hi> arrival, took Boat with Captain <hi>Lessly,</hi> to accompany him for <hi>Levo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 6th Instant I received a Letter from Captain <hi>Lessly,</hi> signifying Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> pleasure, that I should come up with all possible speed, he lying desperately sick, almost past hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; upon receipt whereof I immediately took Boat, and arriving the 8th Instant at <hi>Levo,</hi> found Captain <hi>Coats</hi> and <hi>Don Joseph d' Haeredia</hi> at Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Lodgings, opposite to the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> House, but himself so very ill that there was no speaking to him: That night hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be the Crisis of his Distemper, which being past, his Feaver the next day began to abate, and being informed that I was come up, he sent for me to his Bed-side, and desired me to peruse all his Papers that were in the Escrutore, which was kept for his particular Concerns, and out of them collect and Inventory of all his Personal Estate, and reduce all his Accompts into a Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger form, and bring them to a Ballance, which accordingly I went about, and in fourteen dayes time compleated; he in the mean time growing somewhat better in Health; so that at length he was able to walk about in his Room. When I had finished, and shewn him the Book, by the Ballance whereof it appeared, that his Estate in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>India</hi> at that time, amounted to 1574 <hi>Cattees</hi> of Silver, besides his Plate, Jewels and Rubies, left at <hi>Mergen,</hi> to the amount of 322 <hi>Cattees,</hi> and in his Stock in Partnership with the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> 400 <hi>Cattees;</hi> he ordered me to write out another Leidger by it, only leaving out all his Adventures and Stock abroad, except those wherein the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> was concerned with him, saying, that he still doubted, whether he should ever recover his sickness, and that the compleat one, which contained his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Estate both in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> he would commit to Mr. <hi>Heaths</hi> custody, whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for one of his Executors, and the other, which was to contain only that part of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Stock and Accompt which appeared, and lay depending in the Kingdom and City of <hi>Syam,</hi> should be left amongst his other Books for the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> perusal, when he should make enquiry into his Estate: This was done in six or seven days more. And now having gathered a little more strength, he adventured too early over the way to wait upon his Honour, who in two or three days successively that he went to him, not carrying it with his formerly wonted free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and familiarity, by standing longer than he was well able, bare headed in the cold, and being much dejected at the alteration he observed in his Lordships Carriage towards him, he fell into a Relapse, in which, though his Feaver was not so violent as before, yet he had a worse and more dangerous pain in his Stomach and Bowels, which indeed rendered his condition to our appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance desperate, nor yet did his Lordship, notwithstanding he lived so near, and saw one or other of the House every day, so much as once make enquiry after his Health; only the Lady <hi>Phaulkon</hi> would by <hi>Padry Pomaz,</hi> send him sometimes what she thought might be grateful to him, and proper for him.</p>
               <p>Having as aforesaid begun this Month with fruitless visits to his Lordships, and finding himself dangerously Relapst, he sends for me, and in the midst of his Agonies and roaring Pains, dictates a Letter to his Lordship, which he ordered me to send to him by his Servant <hi>Joan.:</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were to this purpose, for he would not permit me to Register it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He complained of, and admired at the occasion of his Lordships unwonted strangeness to him; That he doubted not but he had many Enemies, who had been secretly endeavouring to possess his Honour with an ill Opinion of him, which was the common fate of most men in publick and weighty Employment: That having now one foot in the Grave, he could safely averr (and nothing troubled his Conscience now so much as that) that he had been always more Zealous for the Honour and Interest of his Master the King, then in his own Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Creator, under whose afflicting Hand he now lay, perhaps for no one sin of a more hainous provocation; and therefore desired the favour and satisfaction, before he dyed, of being informed, wherein it was that he stood culpable before his Majesty or his Honour, which kindness if it could not be granted him, he would however lay his hand upon his mouth, resolving to acquiesce in his Lordships opinion of him, which he hoped would not reach him to the prejudice of his Reputation, when in the Grave; for if it should please God to recover him from his sickness, he was so Conscious to himself of his own innocency in all matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to his publick Administration of his great Masters Affairs; That the first thing he would do, should be to throw himself at his Lordships Feet, for an Impartial Sentence of Life or Death, according to his merits, in confidence, that his Lordship would not, without just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, take delight in plucking down the Building which his own hands had raised.</q>

               <p>This Letter, I could perceive both from his Gesture, and several expressions which he let fall when he gave it me to peruse and file, had very different effects upon Mr. <hi>White;</hi> some Clauses seeming very tart, and others not only more moderate, but giving him some hopes, that matters would not go so bad as he before suspected.</p>
               <p>In a few days after this, he was once more upon his Legs, though still very weak; and now he was not so much concern'd about re-establishing himself in his Lordships good opinion, as apprehensive that he should not be permitted to return to <hi>Mergen,</hi> where he said, not only his Interest, but his Safety invited him to reside, as being there at a great distance from the Courts Eyes, and capable of leaving the Kingdom, whensoever his inclinations or any other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should render it either eligible or necessary so to do; for now <hi>Coats</hi> blows him in the Ear, that his Lordship seemed to be disposed to keep Mr. <hi>White</hi> near himself, and commit the <hi>Tenassery</hi> Affairs to the management of Mounsieur <hi>Forbien,</hi> a young Gentleman, highly in favour with his Lordship, and at present, Governour of <hi>Bankoke</hi> Forts: This made such an impression in Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> fancy, that he was easily wrought upon by <hi>Coats</hi> to believe what he most dreaded, and accordingly (without so much as suspecting <hi>Coats</hi> double dealing, who made it his daily business to wind himself into his secrets) he presently orders to be drawn out all his <hi>Mergen</hi> Accompts, and together with the Invoice of all his Merchandize, Ships stores and moveables there, sent them enclosed in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Burneby,</hi> wherein he impowered him fully to act as his Attorney, and complaining of the alteration he had found in his former Friend the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to possess him with a belief, that the <hi>French</hi> Interest was now most prevalent at Court: That the said <hi>Forbien</hi> was to rule the roast at <hi>Mergen,</hi> and concludes, that all things being like to be suddenly turned topsey turvey, Mr. <hi>Burneby's</hi> wisest course would be to withdraw, whilst he had liberty; and using what means he could to turn off Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> effects at any rate, finds
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:207011:6"/>some way for remitting the amount, by Bill to Mr. <hi>George White</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for the said <hi>Samuel Whites</hi> Accompt, which he thought would be best done by Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi>'s assistance from <hi>Madrass,</hi> whither (if he saw not Mr. <hi>White</hi> in person at <hi>Mergen</hi> before <hi>October</hi> should be past) he should without expectance of further advices, immediately dispatch the Ship <hi>Delight</hi> with all his effects then by him, and that if Mr. <hi>Burneby</hi> himself had no inclination as yet to leave the Country, he would however not fail (in order to the dispatch of the said Ship) to collect all the Debts in those parts, due to the said <hi>White;</hi> and dispose of his Merchandize, Ships stores, and House moveables, for ready money, at any rate, and not disappoint him in the Lading the produce on her, consigning it as above directed. Mr. <hi>How</hi> was also written to, to deliver all Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> concerns, that were in his care, to Mr. <hi>Burneby;</hi> Mr. <hi>Tuttie</hi> was ordered to do the like: And these distracted kind of Letters being finished, to prevent interception, a Servant of <hi>Don Josephs</hi> was pitcht upon to carry it in a Cover, directed to <hi>Padre Francis Perez</hi> at <hi>Tenassery,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> not thinking it convenient that his Lordship should know of his writing to <hi>Mergen,</hi> which if the man had taken out, a <hi>Tarrae</hi> would perhaps have come to his notice.</p>
               <p>The latter half of this month was taken up in Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Examination, by the <hi>Barcalong,</hi> and his Lordship, <hi>Syam</hi> Secretary, <hi>Padre Pomaz</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Jesuite being Interpreter between them: In the end, his Lordship (having kept from all their privities, whatsoever might have proved unanswerable by, and of most dangerous consequence to the Examinant) sends for Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and tells him, (as he afterwards told me) well Sir, you are clear'd, but you must know that you owe your escape to me, as I owe my self, and all I have to your good Brother <hi>George;</hi> if I have frown'd on you, read that Paper, and 'twill satisfie you that I had reason; and if that be not enough to convince you, I can produce several of your own Letters wherein you have, so far forgotten your self, as to abuse us with not a few flat Contradictions; and I make no doubt but your Accounts, if throughly scann'd, would appear notoriously unhandsome; but not being desirous to Ruine you, I forbore exposing you or them to the strict Examination which the matter justly required; whereupon he gave him those very Orders, which (I have before said) he sent <hi>Coates</hi> to make War upon <hi>Metchlepatam;</hi> which so dasht Mr. <hi>White,</hi> that he had scarce a word to say, but (as he phrased it to me) though it better to hand a Sail in time, than carry a Mast by the Board: And after a large Recapitulation of several Misdemeanors, he had to charge him with, which yet he had kept from the knowledge of the foresaid Secretaries, without giving him the Liberty to make his Defence, he told him 'twas his pleasure to pretermit them for this time, as they were; and was not willing to have those Faults, which were but too great in themselves, heightned by any Excuses; but hop'd that this would be a Caution to him for the future; Nor was he to think, that though he lov'd his Friend well, yet he would ruine himself to skreen him from that Justice which his own demerits should pull upon him.</p>
               <p>This month, Captain <hi>Coates,</hi> and <hi>Don Joseph</hi>'s Concerns came under debate; Captain <hi>Coates</hi> past Examination, and came off with Applause, having a Gold Hilted Sword, and rich Coat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him, besides the Admiralship of the Kings Naval forces at <hi>Siam;</hi> but never a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Money, of which poor man he stands more in need than of empty Titles; his Accounts past Currant, partly because had he been narrowly searcht into, Mr. <hi>White</hi> could not have been safe, and partly for that his Lordship knew him to be Insolvent, so that <hi>Coates</hi> himself could after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards boast, that 'twas his Happiness that he was not worth the Fleecing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Joseph d' Haeredias</hi> Accounts were bandied to and fro at another rate. The <hi>Shabander</hi> throws him upon the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> and he again upon the <hi>Shabander,</hi> and this <hi>vice versa</hi> five or six times over, though neither of them had any thing to object against the reasonableness of them; but here lay the choak Pear; the <hi>Don</hi> had got a good new Ship under foot, which Mr. <hi>White</hi> (as had been formerly hinted) had a mind to hook to himself, designing her for the <hi>China</hi> Trade from <hi>Tenassery,</hi> and just such a Ship as she was the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> wanted for the <hi>Manilba</hi> Trade, in company with the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Pullicherry;</hi> now for either of them to pay the <hi>Don</hi> for her, would not correspond with the new mode, which had supplyed them with several good ones at an easier rate, and yet have her the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> must, though indeed Mr. <hi>White</hi> ever intended he should; however the Governour of <hi>Metchlepatam</hi> had seized on three thousand <hi>Pagodoes</hi> of his Majesties from <hi>Don Joseph. Don Joseph</hi> had gone to that Port without orde<gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Mouth was closed with a happy discovery of a conspiracy made by the <hi>Macassars,</hi> who were secretly abetted by many disaffected persons of great Authority and Interest in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The design was to have fired the City of <hi>Syam;</hi> and whilst all the Inhabitants were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:207011:7"/>busied in quenching the Fire, to have made themselves Masters of the Pallace, whilest on the same night a select number were to possess themselves of the Palace at <hi>Levo,</hi> and murder the King with the favourite stranger, (as they called the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi>) and all the <hi>Europeans,</hi> being lookt upon as his Creatures But three days before the intended Assassination, some of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators, whose hearts failed them, discovered the whole Plot, whereupon strong Guards were kept, four or five hundred of the Combination seized, several of them, to the number of two hundred, immediately Executed, and so the whole design for that time quasht.</p>
               <p>The King designing (now the Conspiracy was supprest) to take the first luckly day (which his <hi>Talepoys</hi> pretended would be the 18th of this month) to remove to <hi>Syam;</hi> we were ordered to be gone the 10th, on which day we left <hi>Levo;</hi> in a short time after us, the King and the whole Court, with the <hi>Persian</hi> Embassadour, and his retinue, came down to <hi>Syam;</hi> where his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was so taken up with the more general Affairs of the Kingdom, and obliged to so constant an attendance at Court, that now Mr. <hi>White</hi> could not get an opportunity to wait on him, which however tended not at all to his disadvantage; for the <hi>Herbert,</hi> Captain <hi>Ʋdall,</hi> Arriving at this juncture, and bringing Letters from his Brother, Mr. <hi>George White,</hi> he had not only the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of answering them, but of contracting a familiar acquaintance with the Captain, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Freighting to the amount of two thousand pound <hi>Sterling</hi> on the said Ship, consigning it to his said Brother, and Mr. <hi>Thomas Povey,</hi> without the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> privity, of whom he still was jealous; though indeed soon after it appeared he had no reason so to be, for the Captain having also brought out Letters from his Brother to his Honour, which gave him a full account of the Reception of his Present at the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and of his vigorous endeavours to have withstood those powerful Enemies, which his Lordship had in <hi>England;</hi> together with a short Letter from his present Majesty; he was so well satisfied with the account he had received, as one night to send for Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and tell him, that he found his Brother <hi>George</hi> so fast and real a Friend to him, that for his sake Mr. <hi>White</hi> might ask what he would, and it should be granted him; Mr. <hi>White</hi> wisely taking opportunity by the foretop, modestly replyed, That he desired nothing but liberty to return to his former station, and that his Lordship would for the future be pleased to prescribe him stated Rules for the management of that employ, that so he might not hence forward be left in the dark how to proceed without hazard of offending.</p>
               <p>He had his desires granted, and returned home more chearful than ever I observed him to have been since <hi>May</hi> last, telling me, that now God be thanked he did not fear <hi>Forbiens</hi> supplanting him, for he was to return to <hi>Mergen;</hi> and sayes he, his Lordship made me offer of fifty <hi>Cattees per</hi> month, besides the perquisites of my Employ should be worth as much more to me, if I would stay here with him, and take upon me the place of <hi>Viador D'as Fazendas,</hi> for the King; and that I should be Enroll'd in the Court Registers as his Successor, in case of his Mortality; but I have with much ado evaded it; for 'tis true, I know he wants some body near him, that might be capable of assisting him with advice; and that he has no body, is his great unhappiness; but I do not on any terms like to be the man, though he has more money in his Coffers, and is Laden with as much Honour as he can well bear; yet I shall look upon my Head to stand a great deal faster on my Shoulders than his, so long as there's ere a Ship or Vessel belonging to <hi>Mergen.</hi> The whole Kingdom is under a general discontent at this new way of Government; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this King comes to dye, not only his Honour, but all <hi>Europeans</hi> for his sake, must expect a Bloody Catastrophe, which is no more then what his Lordship, but not like a Politician, openly declared a while agone at his publick Table; and though the King should live many years, yet to tell you truly, I am not without strong apprehensions that his Lordship stands but a slippery place; nor would it be a miracle to see a man that hath been raised from so low a degree to such an exorbitant height of favour with a Prince, unable to withstand the shock of an envious Court, and oppressed Kingdom; and in case he once slips, how can I, or any other dependant on him, expect to keep our footing; so that if once I get to <hi>Mergen</hi> again, I'm resolved never to see <hi>Syam</hi> more upon such a score as now I came up, but ene make Hay whilst the Sun shines, and draw all my Stock, which now lyes scattered abroad, into as narrow a compass as possibly I can, and <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 letter">

On the 14th Instant, the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> in Person, accompanied with about Sixty <hi>English,</hi> (amongst whom were Captain <hi>Ʋdall,</hi> and another Gentleman, that came out of <hi>England</hi> with him) and about Seven Thousand <hi>Syammers</hi> with some <hi>French,</hi> began the fight with the <hi>Macassars:</hi> Captain <hi>Ʋdall,</hi> the said Gentleman, Captain <hi>Coats,</hi> Mounsieur <hi>d' Roan,</hi> and three other <hi>French</hi> men were killed the first part of the Battle, but ere night, the <hi>Macassars</hi> were utterly destroyed, Men, Women, and Children; save only of the Princes Sons, a Boy of about Twelve Years of Age; who being taken Prisoner, the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> begg'd his Life of the King; it being now resolved, that all the Natives, which could be discovered to have any hand in the forementioned Conspiracy (of whom by this time were more then One Thousand in durance) should on the Kings return to <hi>Levo,</hi> suffer death without Mercy.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Ʋdall</hi> being now unluckily killed before Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Goods could be Shipt, he must wait Captain <hi>Rea</hi>'s coming up to Town; who being satisfied by the Purser, of the Captains Contract about them, but not knowing that 'twas the major part <hi>Bengala</hi> Raw Silk, which was to be Shipt under colour of <hi>China</hi> Silk, promised to stand to it, and sign the Bills of Lading.</p>
               <p>Now began we to make preparation for <hi>Mergen,</hi> the quantities of Copper and Tutenage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, not being procureable, Mr. <hi>Heath</hi> is ordered to buy up all the Gold he could meet with; Provisions are also made by his Lordship for a <hi>Moco</hi> Voyage, on the Kings Account; Mr. <hi>Franklin</hi> design'd on the <hi>Armenians</hi> great Ship, <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> thither, from <hi>Mergen,</hi> with a very rich Cargoe of <hi>China</hi> Ware, Tynn, Copper, Tutenage, Aggala, Sappan, <hi>&amp;c</hi> to the amount of One Thousand <hi>Cattees;</hi> besides Mr. <hi>White</hi> had liberty, for his care in dispatching her, to Lade for his own Account One Hundred Tons, in what Commodities he pleased, except those above specified; Mr. <hi>White</hi> saying to me, that this was meerly a Complement of his Lordship, for that he knew not any thing else that would be worth his while to send for <hi>Moco;</hi> but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he would see what he could do when he came to dispatch her.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>White</hi> now presented his Lordship with six large and fair <hi>Ruby</hi> Rings, two curious <hi>Saphire</hi> a couple of <hi>Persian</hi> Horses, and silver Furniture very Noble; and her Ladyship with two Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Rubies, one Diamond Ring with five stones, and a striking Watch; which last returned him a present not despicable, consisting of twenty pieces Rich <hi>Silks,</hi> and several Curiosities of superfine <hi>China</hi> Ware: Thus is he again fully restored to his former place, in the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> Favour.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:207011:8"/>
               <p> And now he is order'd to make those proposals he had formerly hinted at in writing by way of Articles, what he thought most conducive to the Government of the province of <hi>Tenassery,</hi> for his Majesties most advantage, and the satisfaction of the people. In compliance wherewith he draws up sixty distinct Articles, which he presented to the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> for Approbation: Amongst the rest was, That no <hi>Europe</hi> Nation whatsoever (the <hi>French</hi> onely, if his Lordship saw good, excepted) should be exempted henceforward from paying the Customes of all Goods Imported, as all <hi>Indian</hi> Nations had been formerly us'd to do; and desired that those sixty Articles might be the standing Rules of Government in his province of <hi>Tenassery,</hi> which his Lordship, that could now scarce deny <hi>Mr. White</hi> any thing Ratify'd by signing them with his own hand. Though the power therein granted the <hi>Shabander</hi> was in effect unlimited, and such as rendred the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours both of <hi>Tenassery</hi> and <hi>Mergen,</hi> no better than Cyphers, and meerly Titular Officers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there was for Forms sake a Commission Issu'd out in <hi>English</hi> under the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> Broad Seal and delivered into Mr <hi>White</hi>'s Custody, which nominated and constituted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who were jointly to consult about all Affairs in that Province, whether relating to the Sea or Land, in times of War or Peace, and to resolve at least the Major part of them, on whatsoever was to be done, and though the <hi>Shabander</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> was the last mentioned in the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as being the lowest in Rank and Title, yet by Virtue of the aforesaid Articles, the rest of the Council were so ty'd up to his Opinion in all matters of moment, that in effect all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer was lodg'd in him, so that now the Government was become meerly Arbitrary, and his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to be the measure of all their proceedings.</p>
               <p>There was only One thing which the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> refused to grant him, which was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for what he had done the last year, in Issuing out all Orders, and Instructions under his own hand, which he desired, alledging, that perhaps he might one time or other be call'd to an Account by the Company for what had past, and he had nothing to shew for his Warrant: which the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> told him, he could not give him, nor was there any reason for him to expect it; and he thought it might be sufficient, That having acted as he had done the last year, he had befriended him so far, as to keep it from his Majesties Ear; besides, should he Grant such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>Ex Post Facto,</hi> it might one time or other prove his Ruine.</p>
               <p>The Persons specified in the foremention'd Commission to Constitute the Council of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Tenassery,</hi> were</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>White</hi> finding he could not obtain a Commission for what he had acted the last year, now desires, that all the Council may be obliged to affix the Seals of their Respective Offices to all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches, Orders or Instructions whatsoever, which he should for the future have occasion to Issue out, to any Commanders of His Majesties Ships, whether on Account of War or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, which was granted him in a Postscript to the forementioned sixty Articles.</p>
               <p>Now also is Mr. <hi>White</hi> order'd, to let all his Letters, which henceforward he should have occasion to remit to Court, relating to His Majesties Affairs, be General, sign'd by Mr. <hi>Burneby</hi> and himself, but never to omit in an accompanying particular from himself to give the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> an Account of whatsoever he thought not proper to come before his Majesty in Council.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Embassadour being design'd over Land to <hi>Mergen,</hi> and thence to <hi>Persia.</hi> The <hi>Shabander</hi> foreseeing the great trouble, and disadvantage 'twould be to him and his Concerns, earnestly solicited to have that design put by, and at length prevail'd, to his great satisfaction to have them sent <hi>Via Surrat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When all things seem'd thus to go according to wish, an unlook'd for, and surprizing Accident happen'd, which damp'd Mr. <hi>White</hi> at such a Rate, that for two days time I thought no other than that either a Relapse into his former Sickness, or somewhat worse would have been the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. The Letters written to Mr. <hi>Burneby, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>July</hi> last, and committed to <hi>Don Joseph</hi>'s Servant to be carryed to <hi>Padree Fran. Perez,</hi> had been intercepted at <hi>Tenassery</hi> by the <hi>Oyea,</hi> and remitted to the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> (who cut off Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s Correspondence, whilst he lay under a Cloud, had given express Order that no Persons should pass between those two Cities without a <hi>Tarrae</hi> from himself) he presently conculding Senior <hi>Ant. Perez,</hi> Brother to the said <hi>Padree</hi> to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:207011:9"/>have a hand in the private conveyance of that Pacquet, thus Intercepted and Return'd, claps him up close prisoner in <hi>Syam</hi> Goal. This comes to the <hi>Shabanders</hi> Ear, and so Examinates him to think that the Lord <hi>Phau kon</hi> would open his Letters, that I could scarce imagine him to have any Soul; and indeed, had the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> perused that Pacquet, Mr. <hi>White</hi> had inevitably been ruin'd, but what I used for an Argument to cheer up Mr. <hi>White</hi> prov'd a real Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> were reconcil'd to him, as we had all the reason in the World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was, he would think it not only below him, but an unfriendly part to shew any jealousie of One, whom he so much respected, by breaking open his Letters; and therefore I advis'd him not only to Patience and Cheerfulness, but to an absolute Silence concerning them to his Lordship, until he saw further of the matter, and accordingly after three days detention of them, the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> sends him the said Pacquet, with the Seals untouch'd, which Mr. <hi>White</hi> receiv'd with no small Joy, and after himself had open'd them all, he order'd me to throw both them and the Origin I Registers of them into the Fire; and the next day, he interceeded for, and obtained the Releasement of the old <hi>Portugueze</hi> Gentleman, but the suddenness as well as unjustness of his Imprisonment (for he had no hand in the matter) had made such an Impression upon his aged Spirits, that he could not recover the Fright, but in a few days after dyed.</p>

               <p>In the beginning of this Month, Mr. <hi>White</hi> recollecting what he had by this conveyance, and several others <hi>Via Madrass,</hi> order'd to be remitted to his Brother <hi>George,</hi> and finding it all to Amount to about Twelve Thousand pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> thought best for Mortality-sake to constitute his said Brother, and Mr. <hi>Thomas Povey</hi> of <hi>VVestminster,</hi> his joynt Attorneys, impowering them to make a Purchase with the said Moneys of Lands for his two Daughters <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Susan,</hi> and to do the like with whatsoever Sum he should at any time hereafter Consign to them, or either of them; which Letters of Attorney being drawn in Duplicates, one was sent on the <hi>Herbert,</hi> and the other design'd to be sent by Mr. <hi>Francis Heath,</hi> who was to go for <hi>England, Via Madrass.</hi> The <hi>Shabander</hi> having made the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> acquainted (who out of a Principle of Generosity, never order'd his last years Books to be Examined) that the ensuing Monsoons Expedition, which then was design'd to employ Eight Sail of Ships, would require a supply of ready Cash for the payment of Soldiers and Seamens Sallaries, and Arrears from the First of <hi>July</hi> last, besides three Months advance according to the last years Custom; his Lordship order'd the <hi>Syam Clong</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with Three Hundred <hi>Cattees</hi> to carry down with him; but told him that he expected that he should out of the penalties of Offenders, Rents, Incomes of <hi>Tynn,</hi> and sale of a parcel of <hi>Prize Goods,</hi> which yet lay at <hi>Tenassery,</hi> raise whatsoever should be requirable more for that Account: And that for the future, the <hi>Shabander</hi> (being now impower'd to lay several conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Taxes on the <hi>Jelinga</hi> Boats, <hi>Jessook</hi> Gardens, and Natives Converted to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, which according to his own proposals could not Amount to less than Two Thousand <hi>Cattees per Annum;</hi> besides the Custom of Foreign Goods Imported, none now being to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused but only the <hi>French,</hi> and Six Thousand <hi>Peculls</hi> of <hi>Sappan-wood,</hi> to be yearly cut for the Kings Account, with the Engrossing of all Forreign Salt, and imposing it on the Natives at the Kings price, <hi>viz.</hi> ten <hi>Ta.</hi> per <hi>Quogan</hi> (which was nothing but a neat invention of Mr. <hi>VVhite</hi> to rid his hands of about five Hundred <hi>Quogans</hi> of that Commodity, then lying in his own <hi>Godowns</hi>) none being henceforward allow'd to make <hi>Salt</hi> with <hi>Paddy</hi> straw, he was not to expect any more Cash from <hi>Syam,</hi> but be careful that the Port of <hi>Mergens</hi> Charges were defray'd out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Province, it being hoped that by his prudent management of matters, there should be in a little time a considerable Bank of Cash founded in <hi>Mergen,</hi> so that His Majesty might reap benefit proportionable to the vast Expence, which for these three years last past he had been at, in fortifying that Province, with Garrisons and Shipping.</p>

               <p>The remains of the <hi>Delights</hi> Cargo amounting to about Forty Cattees of Silver, being a parcel of Longcloth and Bettelees, Mr. <hi>White</hi> resolved to take wholly upon his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and allow Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi> for his Moiety, but yet thought best to make use of his Name to the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> in the matter, desiring him to order it into the Kings <hi>Ciong,</hi> and send the Amount in Copper, at 6 ½ Tale <hi>per</hi> Chest, on the Arrival of the <hi>Jappan Juncks,</hi> so early, that he might have an opportunity to remit it to his Friend Mr. <hi>Lucas,</hi> or For want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in <hi>Copangs,</hi> it being so requested of him by his said Friend, as he pretended, for I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, that though his Lordship knew very well, that Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi> maintain'd an intimate correspondence with each other, yet he was kept wholly ignorant, that they were Partners in the <hi>Delight,</hi> and her Cargo, nor did Mr. <hi>White,</hi> as he would often say, think it prudence to let his Lordship know either what his Stock was, or how, or where em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, more than that part of it, which he had in Company with his Lordship in the <hi>China</hi> Trade, which now he was resolv'd to make it his business, by little and little, (with what circumspection he could to avoid suspicion) to withdraw, whereas his Lordship, though in vain) endeavoured what he could, to draw on Mr. <hi>White</hi> do deeper engagement, to those Trade of the Seas, thinking by that means to make surer of him, but that not sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> inclinations, or designs, he as subtly finds Evasions, as the other could Arguments to perswade.</p>
               <p>The Sixteenth of the Month we left <hi>Syam,</hi> and with Five <hi>Merua's</hi> began our Voyage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Queal,</hi> The Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> just before our going, sent his Trumpeter to me with Four Cattees of Money, and Two pieces of <hi>China</hi> Silk, who told me his Lordship had sent me that small Token, and expected my acceptance of it for old acquaintance sake, which I did, and returning him my thanks by the same Bearer, had only time enough to invest it, in what was most likely to yield me good advantage at <hi>Mergen,</hi> and so took Boat that Night.</p>
               <p>The Eighteenth we met Mr. <hi>James Wheeler</hi> at <hi>Bankoke,</hi> the Ship <hi>Phoenix</hi> from <hi>Madrass,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coming (though not yet entred the River) for the Copper his Lordship the last year had promised him, He gave Mr. <hi>White</hi> an Account, that the Coyn, and Bullion, Gold, and Silver which Mr. <hi>White</hi> had committed to his care in <hi>March</hi> last, (being part of what he had taken out of the Ships brought in from <hi>Pegu</hi>) was sold, and the Amount according to order paid into the Diamond Traders, Senior <hi>Bartholomew Rodriguez,</hi> and Company, for invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and remittance to his Brother <hi>George</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which they designed to do by the <hi>Kempthorn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By him also Mr. <hi>White</hi> had an Account, how the business was managed in the Jewel Affair at <hi>Madrass,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Yale</hi>'s disgusts against the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> and that the Company had a design meerly for the conveniency of annoying <hi>Tenassery,</hi> to settle upon <hi>Poynt Negraes,</hi> which Mr. <hi>White</hi> seemed to be very much troubled at, and after Mr. <hi>Wheelers</hi> parting from us, swore most bitterly he would prevent them, if they were not got thither already, for if they were not there now, they could not possibly get thither, until <hi>February</hi> next from <hi>Madrass.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In three dayes arriving from <hi>Bankoke</hi> at <hi>Queal.</hi> Mr. <hi>White,</hi> Mr. <hi>Heath,</hi> and Captain <hi>Lesley</hi> posted away for <hi>Mergen,</hi> with <hi>Doolys</hi> doubly mann'd, leaving me to follow with the Treasure, with which I hasten'd so speedily after them, as to arrive at <hi>Mergen,</hi> the first of <hi>November,</hi> where I found they had got but three days before me.</p>

               <p>In <hi>May</hi> last I had noted, that the <hi>Clong</hi> Accounts were ballanced, by being charg'd (I mean all Ships stores) as expended on the several Ships, so that the Kings <hi>Godowns</hi> being thus emptied, none remain'd, but what the <hi>Shabander</hi> called his own; and now on our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, the first work was to acquaint the <hi>Coromocon,</hi> with the indispensible necessity of buying into the <hi>Clong</hi> a competent quantity of Stores, for the fitting out of the Kings Ships to Sea, and that Mr. <hi>Tuttie</hi> had a parcel lying by him, fit for the purpose. Thus did Mr. <hi>White</hi> at one clap, sell the King his own Goods, to the Amount of Two Hundred and Eighty Cattees of Silver, which now he appointed the <hi>Syammers</hi> to keep account of their Expence, as he should from time to time appoint the delivery of them out, pretending 'twas a thing he would no longer trouble himself with, or spend Paper about, and 'twas fittest they should be satisfied, which way the Kings Stores were disposed, that so he might not be suspected of imbezling them, or converting them to his own use.</p>
               <p>The next thing was the payment of the Garrison, and Sea-mens Arrears, which was so dexterously managed by Mr. <hi>White,</hi> in observance of the method used at the last payment, as to make Three Hundred Cattees do the business of Five Hundred Forty Six Cattees, which I thought was a very smart beginning, after his so narrow escape of a severe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:207011:10"/>at <hi>Levo,</hi> and such an Action as made me wish his promised Ship in a readiness, that I might be freed from such a kind of Book keeping.</p>
               <p>The Tenth of this Moneth putting Mr. <hi>White</hi> in mind of his promise, made me the latter end of <hi>August</hi> last, he put me off, telling me that he had a great jealousie (from Mr. <hi>Wheelers</hi> discourse at <hi>Bankoke</hi>) that the Company had Wars in <hi>Bengala,</hi> which made it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous to adventure a Ship thither; besides he doubted Mr. <hi>Edward Inglish</hi> in the Ship <hi>Revenge,</hi> had been seized on by the Companies Ships; however, if I would have patience to stay till he had certain Advices of Peace or War; if 'twas peace in the Bay, I should without fail proceed in <hi>February,</hi> and if War, I should not only have liberty to take the first oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a passage, but besides my Sallary, be gratified for the good Services I had hitherto done him, so as not to complain of the disappointment, in his not sending a Ship of his own: But at length, with much importuning, I obtain'd his consent to take my passage on <hi>Authony de Cruz,</hi> who designed to sail from <hi>Mergen</hi> towards the <hi>Bay,</hi> twelve or fourteen days hence, there being at this time in Port, no less than four Ships bound for <hi>Bengala,</hi> who had put in here to Winter, <hi>viz.</hi> The aforesaid <hi>Anthony d' Cruz, Skipper, Michael Don Joan d' Leon,</hi> and <hi>John Graunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this interim (Mounsieur <hi>D' Houtmeniel</hi> in a <hi>French</hi> Ship, being on the dispatch for <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licherry,</hi> the <hi>Delight</hi> for <hi>Madrass,</hi> the <hi>Dorothy</hi> now called the <hi>Mergen</hi> Frigat, and <hi>Robin,</hi> now called the <hi>Advice,</hi> being to go and cruise upon the Coast of <hi>Pegu,</hi> with strict orders to bring in whatsoever Ships they should meet, and could over-power (without any respect to their Passes) that so they might be examin'd in this Port, and clear'd or condemn'd, as should appear reasonable. I had no want of business to employ my time Night and Day.</p>
               <p>The Day that Senior <hi>Athony de Cruz</hi> sailed, being the 24th Instant, early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) I carried Mr. <hi>White</hi> the Keys of his Escretores, wherein were all his Books and Papers, desiring that Forenoons liberty to carry my things on Boad, the Ship being to sail in the Evening; he then told me that he could not possibly spare me at that time, but <hi>Don Joan d' Leon</hi> would be going in <hi>December,</hi> and then he would not offer to detain me any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whereupon I consented to stay so long, rather than disoblige him.</p>
               <p>The 26th of this moneth, all the Soldiers and Seamen were paid advance money, to the first of <hi>January</hi> next, in which payment the same method was observ'd by the <hi>Shabanders</hi> express order, to his no small advantage.</p>
               <p>The last year, check for dispatching the <hi>Phaulkon</hi> to <hi>Atcheen,</hi> without order, did not restrain the <hi>Shabander</hi> from the like practice now, only he was resolv'd to have a plausible pretence for so doing, if it should happen to come to the Court Ears, and so on pretence of her cruising to the South-ward, sends her with ready money to <hi>Junkselone,</hi> for procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Tynn,</hi> and thence to <hi>Atcheen,</hi> to enquire out, and call hither Mr. <hi>William Soam,</hi> who had now been near twenty moneths gone on a Trading Voyage to those parts, with a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go of a Hundred and Twenty Cattees, the Amount.</p>

               <p>A new ship which had been ordered by the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> to be set upon the stocks for the King, being Lanch'd this last month, and called the <hi>Resolution,</hi> was now Rigg'd and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Cruise on the Coast of <hi>Chormondell, Alexander Lesly</hi> being Commissionated under the said Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> Seal to Command her, and follow such instructions, as should from time to time be given him by Mr. <hi>White</hi> the <hi>Shabander</hi> of <hi>Tenassery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Instructions Mr. <hi>White</hi> gave him, were to make the Land, on the Coast <hi>Gingerlee</hi> in eighteen Degrees of North Latitude, to feize all Ships or Vessels whatsoever he should meet with, (those of <hi>Europe</hi> Nations only excepted) and such as he thought not convenient to bring to <hi>Mergen,</hi> or keep in his company, having first taken out all their Goods, and Men, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them as prisoners of War, to burn, sink and destroy the Vessels; To send his Boat on shoar at <hi>Chiskercol,</hi> and if possible surprise the Governour, or some of the most eminent Inhabitants, and carrying them on board his ship, there propose to them their liberty on such terms, as he might think their Estates, by the best information would reach; which if they complyed with in a limited time, then to release them without any harm to their persons, if they proved obstinate, or broke promise in their payment, then to fire the town, burn or sink all the Boats in the River, and bring off as many Men, Women, and Children as they could seize, securing them on board as Prisoners of War; thence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to all the Ports, Rivers, Harbours, Creeks, or Bays along the Coast of <hi>Chormondell,</hi> betwixt that place and <hi>Madrass,</hi> except only such places where the <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> had Factories, using the same method of proceeding; and yet for as much as it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, the King of <hi>Golcondab</hi> would send an Embassadour to the Court of <hi>Syam,</hi> if any such motion were made to Captain <hi>Lesly,</hi> he should grant them a safe Pass-port to come to <hi>Mergen,</hi> where order would be taken for his Reception, according to his quality; but he was not to consent to any Cessation of Arms, or desistance from the prosecution of the above faid instructions, until he should receive an express Order for so doing, or the time therein limited was expir'd, which was the first of <hi>May</hi> next, for he was to follow this method of Hostility until that day, and then directing his course to <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such Letters, Packets, or Goods as the General, Monsieur <hi>Martin,</hi> and monsieur <hi>Des Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres Borean</hi> should put on Board his ship, and so making all convenient dispatch thence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn directly to the Port of <hi>Mergen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But being thus in readiness to be gone, an accident fell out, which for some days de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded his dispatch. Thus,</p>
               <p>Unexpected notices arrived from <hi>Syam,</hi> that a Present for the <hi>French</hi> King, from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of <hi>Syam,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> were upon the Road hitherward, which Dr. <hi>Hoatme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was required to take into his ship, and carry for <hi>Europe,</hi> taking also the ship <hi>Jerusalem</hi> under his Convoy to <hi>Pullicherry;</hi> now 'twas true though Dr. <hi>Hoatmeniel</hi> went out of the Harbour the last month with his ship, yet having occasion for some Timbers, for uses at <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> which he could not be supplyed with at the Town, he stop at <hi>Ilha Grande</hi> to cut such as he wanted with his own people, and not being gone thence when this news arrived, Mr. <hi>White</hi> sends down Mr. <hi>Burnebey</hi> to inform him of it, and propose his staying a few days, for the Presents which were coming. Dr. <hi>Hotamentiel</hi> tole Mr. <hi>Burnebey</hi> he was willing on his part to oblige the King of <hi>Syam,</hi> and his Excellency, what lay in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but his Master the King of <hi>France</hi> had assixed him a day to sail from. <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> and the General had limitted him a day for his sailing hence, which would be the next Sunday, and if the Present came in that time, he would be glad of opportunity to shew his readiness for the King of <hi>Syams</hi> Service, but if not, no consideration could prevail with him to traus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress his orders, the Present not arriving in the time presixt by. Dr. <hi>Hoatmeniel,</hi> the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bander</hi> stops the <hi>Resolution,</hi> and concludes that he should carry it to <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> and take the Saint <hi>John</hi> with her Cargo of <hi>Sappan-wood,</hi> for his honour, and <hi>Allome</hi> for himself under her Convoy.</p>
               <p>Two days after Dr. <hi>Hoatmeniel</hi> failing from <hi>Ilha Grande,</hi> the Present arrived at <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> accompanied with the usual state of the Country musick, <hi>Lesly</hi> taking it into the <hi>Resolution,</hi> was dispatcht with additional Orders to this purpose. That taking the ship <hi>Saint John</hi> under his Convoy, he should conduct her safe to <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> and there deliver her and her Lading to Monsieur <hi>Des Landres Borean</hi> (no <hi>Des Landres</hi> was to send her in his own name to the Bay of <hi>Bengala,</hi> there to lade Butter, and Oyl, with some Cloth, and so to return to <hi>Syam</hi>) and to deliver the Letters with the King, and Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> Presents
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:207011:11"/>for the <hi>French</hi> King to the General <hi>Martine,</hi> siring twenty one Guns at his putting them out of the ship. And because Mr. <hi>White</hi> would make use of all opportunities to his own advantage, more or less, he now draws a Bill on Monsieur <hi>Des Landres</hi> for delivery of four hundred Pagodos to Captain <hi>Lesly,</hi> on the King of <hi>Syam</hi>'s account, advising up to Court that he had done it for the supply of whatsoever occasions the ship might have, during that her expedition on the Coast, whereas at the same time he gave Captain <hi>Lesly</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make use of only one hundred of the Pagodos, and ordered him to invest the other three hundred in Brown <hi>Bettelees,</hi> which he was to keep in the ship untill his return hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lesly</hi> was also ordered by Mr. (<hi>White</hi> in the nature of a Warrant) to discard, and turn out of this ship, whomsoever by word or action, he should during this Expedition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be disaffected towards the King of <hi>Syam</hi>'s Service, and to entertain, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage as many new men as he could possibly meet with, only not to agree with them for Sallary, or give them any office untill their Arrival here, when according to the Character he should give of them, each man should have encouragement and Employs.</p>
               <p>By this Conveyance of <hi>Lesly</hi> in the <hi>Madrass</hi> Pacquet <hi>Via Pullicherry,</hi> went also a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Mr. <hi>White</hi> to his Attorneys in <hi>England,</hi> under cover to Mr. <hi>Francis Heath,</hi> to give them notice, that upon later thoughts, and clearer prospect into the unsetled posture which the Afsairs of <hi>India</hi> were posting to, he had altered his opinion, as to the seiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of sending out a permission ship to him, and therefore advised their disistance from the undertaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lesly</hi> being thus dispatcht, Mr. <hi>White</hi> (computing the time, when he might reasonably get into eighteen Degrees North Latitude on the Coast of <hi>Gingerlee</hi> from <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> allowing fourteen days for his passage from <hi>Mergen</hi> thither) accordingly drew up orders for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Cropley</hi> on the fifteenth of <hi>January</hi> next to leave <hi>Mergen</hi> and <hi>Elves,</hi> with their sloops at the Bar of <hi>Sirian,</hi> and make the best of his way towards that Coast, in eighteen Degrees Latitude, where he was to ply off and on, (being every day once at least in sight of the Land) untill he should meet with <hi>Lesly</hi> in the <hi>Resolution,</hi> with whom he was to joyn Company, Consult, and be assisting each to other in the vigorous, and punctual execution of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said orders, of which a Copy was remitted to <hi>Cropley,</hi> and now Mr. <hi>White</hi> called to mind, what Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> had told him of the design at <hi>Madrass</hi> to settle upon <hi>Point Negraes,</hi> and send Mr. <hi>Thomas Yale</hi> for Governour, which he apprehended would be of very ill consequence to this Port, and therefore resolving to kill two Birds with one stone, he concludes to send two small Vessells, which taking <hi>Cropley</hi> in their way at the Bar of <hi>Siri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> should deliver him those Orders, and carry to <hi>Point Negraes</hi> twenty <hi>Lulongs</hi> or <hi>Syam</hi> Soldiers, with a Commander furnished with all necessaries for twelve months time, who should keep possession of the place for the King of <hi>Syam,</hi> and on the appearance of any ship, let fly his Flag, for which end they were to erect a Flag-Staff near to the most convenient Landing place, and for the better declaration of their business there, they carryed this following Inscription in Capital <hi>Portuguees</hi> Letters, pasted on a small board, with a small boarded house to shelter it from weather, which was to be placed near the Flag-staff, Mr. <hi>White</hi> ordering it to be Forged in <hi>Mergen,</hi> and dated, as if done the foregoing <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Syam.</hi> The words these.</p>

               <p>Now whereas Captain <hi>Lesly</hi> was ordered on the first of <hi>May</hi> next, to shape his course for <hi>Pullicherry</hi> as aforesaid, Captain <hi>Cropley</hi> had orders sent him on the same day, to direct his course to <hi>Saint Thome,</hi> and thence send a Letter to the President and Council at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drass,</hi> to inform them that he had a message from the Court of <hi>Syam,</hi> which he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to some of the Council, if they pleased to give him a meeting at <hi>Saint Thome,</hi> and in case any of them came thither, he was to send his Boat on shoar, and invite them on Board his ship, where he was to read them a Declaration (which for that end was now sent him open) wherein was specified, That he was ordered by his Majesty to represent to them the great abuses M. <hi>Elihu Yale</hi> had put upon him in the Jewel Affair, as also the affronts done him by the Companies Servants in his own Royal City, To certifie them, of his Majesties kindness for sixty years past to the said Company, and that satisfaction being made by Mr. <hi>Yale,</hi> the Lord Treasurer would pay the <hi>Persian</hi> fraight, and release whatsoever he had hitherto detained of theirs, willing them, if they had any Grievances to complain of (though he knew of none) that they would send over two Gentlement fully impowered to treat with his Majestys Ministers of State, and they might expect all the justice they could desire, but if they slighted this proposal, his Majesty had no reason to Court their Friendship.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:207011:11"/>
               <p> This Declaration was drawn up by the <hi>Shabander,</hi> and according to the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> order to him, should have been sign'd by him, but he (upon my earnest pressing of him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, as thinking it not convenient, for that to me it appear'd but one remove from a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of War) was prevailed with, not to sign it, but sent it unsign'd to <hi>Cropely,</hi> ordering him in a Letter, which accompany'd it, That he and the rest of his Officers after the Publication of it, should sign it, and deliver it to those Gentlemen that should come off to him.</p>
               <p>At this time also, the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> sends down express orders to unrig, and lay up the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> great ship, and put by the <hi>Moco Voyage,</hi> keeping all the Kings Goods in the <hi>Tenassary Clongs,</hi> for their better security, since he had apprehensions, that the Gentlemen on the other side would not fail to intercept her on her Voyage, nor could he think it safe for any ships to go abroad this year upon a Mercantile Account, but gave strict charge, that whatsoever Frigats went out on a design against the Enemy, should be so well equipt, as to be able to encounter any force, the Company could make against them.</p>
               <p>To this the <hi>Shabander</hi> (who was mighty fearful of being call'd up to reside at Court, if once the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> should grow apprehensive of a breach with the English) return'd for answer; that his Lordships orders in laying up the St. <hi>George,</hi> and putting the <hi>Moco</hi> Cargo in the <hi>Tenassary Clongs,</hi> should not fail of all due observance, though he was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a different opinion, nor could he apprehend any danger, had she proceeded; Twas true, he did not question, but <hi>Yale</hi> had malice enough to put him upon any attempt whatsoever, to the prejudice of his Majesty and his Lordship, but yet he could not believe him so rash, as to break out into any open act of hostility, without order from <hi>England,</hi> and such a power could not possibly arrive him, until the next year, and that he supposed his Lordship gave too much ear to the reports of Mr. <hi>Wheeler,</hi> and such as were either strongly prejudiced against Mr. <hi>Yale</hi> in particular, or took delight in putting the Kings Affairs into a distraction.</p>
               <p>And indeed this putting by of the <hi>Moco</hi> Voyage on the St. <hi>George,</hi> for fear of Mr. <hi>Yale,</hi> was an acceptable hit to the <hi>Shabander,</hi> who was clearly of opinion, That if the Company had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into a War in <hi>Bengala,</hi> their hands would be so full, they would not at present break with <hi>Syam,</hi> especially considering the conveniency their ships by continuing in amity, might have, in the free use of this Point, on any occasion, wherefore having a great quantity of the Kings Goods in his hands, which were likely to lye by in the <hi>Clongs,</hi> he thought it a brave opportunity to secure into his own hands, to the value of what stock he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with his <hi>Honcur</hi> at <hi>Syam,</hi> with whom he did not conceive if safe, being doubtful, that if ever a second difference should happen, the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> would detain it for reimburse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Two Hundred <hi>Cattees,</hi> which His Majesty had lent Mr. <hi>White</hi> for Six Years, at his first entrance into his <hi>Shabandership,</hi> and accordingly he fits out with all possible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the ship <hi>Tokely,</hi> which now he names the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for a two-fold reason, as she sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the <hi>Moor</hi> Mans Debt to him, and as her Cargo would secure him that part of his stock, which he otherwise lookt upon to be in Hucksters hands, though he thought it not convenient, to let his Lorship know one word of it, nor any of the Natives whither the ship was bound.</p>
               <p>Only one thing was likely to thwart the sorting of the Cargo to his own mind, that was the want of a sufficient quantity of Tynn, for his Lordship had now sent down an Order to him to deliver Mr. <hi>John Thredder,</hi> One Hundred and Twenty Baharrs, at one Cattee <hi>per</hi> Baharr, which would so exhaust the Kings store of that Commodity, that he must be forc't to go without it for his <hi>Moco</hi> design, But to remedy this, he at length finds a way; for Mr. <hi>Thredaer</hi> coming to demand his Tynn, and producing an order from the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> for it, he readily tells him, he should have it when he pleased; but his ship being not yet fitted, and being to be laid ashore, and <hi>Caulkt,</hi> if not new sheath'd, he could not expect to be in a readiness to take it in, until the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and therefore 'twould save him so much Warehouseroom, to let it lye where it was in the Kings <hi>Clong,</hi> till his ship was fitted; Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> little thinking of the Snake in the Grass (for Mr. <hi>White</hi> had strictly enjoyn'd my silence) thanks him for his courteous offer, and Mr. <hi>White</hi> puts the Tynn on board his own said Ship <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and then writes up to the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> to incense him what he could against Mr. <hi>John Tyler</hi> in <hi>Bengala,</hi> taxing him with the neglect of His Majesties Affairs, in not sending any Advices how they stand there, and insinuating a jealousie of his imbezling the Kings stock, therefore thinks it but reasonable, that his Honour would please to attache the Tynn which Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> was to receive, until they had a more satisfactory Account how <hi>Tyler</hi> had behaved himself.</p>
               <p>At the same time, with Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> came Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Russel</hi> and his Lady from <hi>Syam,</hi> full of complaints of the disappointment they had met with there; whither his Lorship had invited them from <hi>Surrat,</hi> howerver <hi>Russel</hi> brought an Order for the <hi>Shabander,</hi> to give him an employ at this place.</p>

               <p>The first of this Moneth (<hi>Don John de Leon</hi> designing to sail the third day) I went again to Mr. <hi>White</hi> to desire liberty to make ready for my Voyage to the <hi>Bay,</hi> he, was them more averse to part with me, than ever, asking whether I could be so unkind to leave him now, when he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:207011:12"/>had no body besides my self, that could assist him in his business, or keep him company; now all the ships were gone and going out of the Port, and Mr. <hi>How</hi> was to go upon the ship <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to <hi>Moco,</hi> if I had a mind to send any thing to <hi>Bengala,</hi> he would not only pay me what was due to me on Account of my Sallary, but freely give me half a score <hi>Cattees</hi> to send by the <hi>Don,</hi> and he doubted not, but my Friends would be well enough satisfied in my staying a Month or Six Weeks longer, for he would not desire me to stay any longer, than till Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi>'s ship was ready to go: As to his offer of the Money, I told him I did not think it safe to adventure any thing by a Stranger, If I went not my self with it, in troublesome times, and therefore I thinkt him for his kind offer, but would not accept of it, but upon assurance that I should go in <hi>February,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Thredders</hi> ship (for Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> I thought would hardly go himself without his Tynn) I consented to stay till then, and Mr. <hi>White</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly vow'd I should go, if I pleas'd, without further delay upon the ship <hi>Agent,</hi> and so I consented to wait a moneth longer.</p>
               <p>Now when I permitted my self to be prevailed with, to make an implicite promise of continuing a moneth longer, depending on a passage in the ship <hi>Agent</hi> to the <hi>Bay,</hi> I little suspected Mr. <hi>White</hi> would have employ'd the next night <hi>Ismael Gee,</hi> the <hi>Serange</hi> of the Kings yard, to go and bilge that ship as she lay upon the <hi>Ways,</hi> which by his own relation to Mr. <hi>White</hi> the next morning he said he did, by raving open three Butt-heads of her Plank under her Bilge, and that he was then come to tell him the business was done, and the ship now was full of Water at ¾ Flood. 'Twas then about seven a Clock in the Morning, and being charg'd to keep it private, the fellow was dismist, and no sooner was he gone, but Mr. <hi>White</hi> told me to this effect: Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> your <hi>Bengala</hi> Voyage in the <hi>Agent</hi> is over, but you shall be as soon there, as if she had proceeded, only let me enjoyn you, not to speak a word of what you have now heard; I could have kept it from your knowledge, had I not an intire confidence in, and full experience of your secrecy: I promised him that as I had hitherto, so I would still keep my self free from interfering with all matters, not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to me. About an hour after Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> ignorant of what had past on Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> part, came to him, and complain'd his ship was full of water, and began to lay the fault upon the carelesness of the Skipper <hi>John Bunt,</hi> and the Mate <hi>Nathaniel Carter;</hi> they two transferr'd the blame upon each other, though neither of them could well tell wherein; Mr. <hi>White</hi> glad to see them all in the dark, as to the truth of the matter, ask't why they would offer to lay an old worm-eaten, weak, rotten ship ashoar, that could not bear her own weight with so much ballast in her. The Skipper reply'd, there was no more in her, than what was requisite; at last Mr. <hi>White</hi> promis'd when the Tide was ebb'd away, to go and view her, and if 'twas possible to get her off again; he would lend them all the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the Port could afford, with which answer they departed, and the ship being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards review'd, was sentenced to be irrecoverably lost.</p>
               <p>The sixth instant, the Ship <hi>Satisfaction</hi> failed for <hi>Moco, William Ranns</hi> Commander, at fifteen Tales <hi>per</hi> Month, and one <hi>per Cent.</hi> Commission. <hi>William How, Cape</hi> Merchant, at four <hi>per Cent.</hi> Commission, with a Cargo of near five hundred Cattees, the amount of which being so considerable, all possible care was taken to prevent interception for want of the Companies Pass, and Mr. <hi>White</hi> gave Mr. <hi>How</hi> a Letter of Request to all English Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and other Officers, signifying his Residence in the Kingdom of <hi>Syam,</hi> and incapacity to procure their Pass, by reason of his distance from their Garrisons, therefore desired not only that they would permit the said Ship to proceed without molestation on her Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age out, or home, but grant her their Passes to secure her from any farther stoppage, or interruption, which said Letter Mr. <hi>How</hi> had orders on any occasion to produce, and present to any person that should pretend to stop them; and if that would not do, to tender Bond to the amount of the Ship and Cargo, their value, to answer whatsoever charge or claim should be laid against the Ship, in any of the Companies Ports in <hi>India,</hi> after her Voyage should be compleated. And if that would not do, then he had a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test ready drawn, with a Blank for the Commanders and Ships name, that should pretend to intercept him, and carry him into any of the Companies Ports, which he was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and deliver in the presence of the Master, and chief Mate of the Ship <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but if it proved to be one of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Frigats, then he was only to insert the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders name, in the Protest, and not mention the Frigats name, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to Protest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Frigat because she was the Kings, but only against such a one Commander of such a Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> having lost his Ship as aforesaid (though the manner of losing her was more than he or any belonging to her knew) writes the next day to acquaint the Lord <hi>Phaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon</hi> with his disaster, and requests, that now instead of Tin he might be paid in money the Ballance of his account, he not knowing how to get Freight for such a quantity of Goods as he had to carry: This Letter he gives to Mr. <hi>White</hi> to be forwarded to <hi>Syam,</hi> and desires him also to intercede in his behalf for money instead of the Tin, which he fairly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised he would do. The Letter indeeed Mr. <hi>White</hi> encloses in his own Pacquet, but writes cerning the Tin in a quite different strain, again pressing the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> to Embargo the Tin on account of Mr. <hi>John Tyler,</hi> using all the arguments he could, to shew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of so doing.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:207011:12"/>
               <p> The eighth instant, the ship <hi>Bom Success, John Graunt</hi> Master (which as formerly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, put in here from <hi>Atcheen</hi> to winter) sailed hence, having Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Pass-port to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their interception by any of the Kings ships; she belongs one half to <hi>Arthur Seymour,</hi> and the other half to the <hi>Moors</hi> merchants in <hi>Bengala,</hi> her Burthen about a hundred Tuns. The day after her going over the Bar, the <hi>Shabander</hi> pretending he had been informed, that she had carryed away some Passengers with a Ticket from him, there being then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ship nor sloop in the Harbour, ready to send after her, dispatch'd away his own Barge with nine <hi>English</hi> men well arm'd, to bring her in again: That night they brought her, and the next day being the tenth, the <hi>Nocquedah,</hi> and all the rest being examined, nothing could be found against them, for he had taken out Tickets for all his Passengers, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>White</hi> could not be prevailed with to the contrary, but orders the ship to be unrigg'd and unladen, saying if she appear'd to be clear, 'twas time enough to go to <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi> a month hence, when the Goods were unladen, and weighed off at the Custome-house scales, comparing them with the <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> accounts of the Cargoe, there were four Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hars of Tin more, than what he had in his Invoice: This was pretended by the <hi>Shabander</hi> to have been Tin clandestinely bought from the Officers of the <hi>Clong,</hi> and not having been entred in the Custome-house before it was shipt, made the ship lyeable to seizure; however Mr. <hi>White</hi> kindly offered to write up to <hi>Syam</hi> about it, and according to the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure she should be condemned or cleared: The <hi>Lascars</hi> came and own'd these four Bahars of Tin, saying 'twas what themselves had bought amongst themselves, <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Serango,</hi> &amp;c. Officers at <hi>Atcheen,</hi> and privately laden it without the <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> knowledge, and that it had never been stow'd in hold, but in their own Births, and that it was not any of the Tin of this place, was easie enough to be seen from the form into which it was cast. But all would not do. Mr. <hi>White</hi> alledged he could not clear her without the Kings order. The Pilot alledged in behalf of Mr. <hi>Athur Seymour,</hi> that one half of the ship could not be liable to seizure, it being only let to freight by him, to the rest of the Owners, who were <hi>Moors,</hi> nor had he on his part broke any orders of the Port, and if the <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> had, he did not conceive the ship to be liable, but rather the <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> Purse, Mr. <hi>White</hi> reply'd, that one half must go with the other, and no man ought to presume to instruct him what was Law or Equity, and the more the Pilot prated, the worse he should find it.</p>
               <p>He presently writes up to <hi>Syam</hi> to acquaint the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> with his industrious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Rules of the Port, for his Majesties Interest, and that a <hi>Moors</hi> ship from <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi> having presumptuously broken the orders of it, by carrying off several of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men prisoners of War (which was an absolute untruth) without Licence, and lading Tin clandestinely, without entring it in the Custome-house, he had fetcht her back from <hi>Ilha Ferro,</hi> and did suppose her a lawful Prize, desiring to know his Majesties and Lordships pleasure concerning it, with all convenient speed.</p>
               <p>The twelfth of this month, a <hi>Moor</hi> who had been accused of breaking into the <hi>Shaban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Godown under his house (before our going to <hi>Syam</hi> in <hi>May</hi> last) and stealing two pieces of course Cloth, having ever since been kept in Irons, had his tryal now before the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romocon,</hi> the fact not being proved against him, he was cleared, only on the <hi>Shabanders</hi> motion, he was to continue ten days longer in Irons before his discharge; four or five days after this the fellow broke, or got off his Irons privately, and made his escape to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster a Merchant at <hi>Tenassery,</hi> whom the <hi>Shabander</hi> mortally hated, but was presently by the <hi>Shabanders</hi> order pursued and caught, and on the twentieth of the month being brought back, when the <hi>Shabander</hi> was in no good humour, he immediately ordered his head to be struck off, which was accordingly done by a <hi>Syammer,</hi> at one blow. The intercession of many people to the contrary, not prevailing for the poor mans life, he being resolved, as he vowed with many horrid oaths, and execrations, to make that fellow an example and terrour to all others, that should offer to make their escape, when he had ordered them prisoners. This action was severely censured by all men in private, but none durst openly complain, for fear of coming under the lash of Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s displeasure.</p>
               <p>At this time was the <hi>Derrea, Dowlet</hi> dispatcht to <hi>Atcheen,</hi> Captain <hi>Russel</hi> Commander laden with three hundred and twenty Quoyens of Rice, two hundred being for the Kings account, and consigned to Captain <hi>Russel,</hi> and one hundred and twenty for Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s account, consigned to Mr. <hi>William Mallet,</hi> with six mortevans of <hi>Mergen Arrack,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mallet</hi> having no conveniency to invest his money in Goods proper for <hi>Atcheen,</hi> desired Mr. <hi>White</hi> to accept it, at two <hi>Teculls</hi> a month <hi>per Cattee,</hi> who accordingly did, and gave his account credit for twenty <hi>Cattees</hi> in his Books, the sum he left with him.</p>
               <p>Now also came an order from the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> to prepare a ship to be in a readiness, for the transport of two of the King of <hi>Syams Colwans</hi> to <hi>Gombroone.</hi> who were to go with a message to the Court of <hi>Persia,</hi> the ship being to go with a <hi>French</hi> Pilot, and a Pass sent from the <hi>French</hi> Chief at <hi>Syam,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> immediately returns answer, that the lateness of his Lordships advice, and the want of men, so many ships being already abroad, rendred it impossible to comply with those orders, and farther, that there was not one <hi>French</hi> man in the King of <hi>Syams</hi> Service capable to take any Office in a ship, much less to be a Pilot.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:207011:13"/>
               <p> The <hi>Shabander</hi> having now some jealousie, that all was not well in the Bay, or at the Coast, having no news either of Captain <hi>English,</hi> or the <hi>Deans</hi> Barge (both of them long since expected) did this month dispatch the small sloop <hi>Mary,</hi> to <hi>Pullicherry</hi> with sixty Chests of Copper, consigned to Monsieur <hi>Des Landres Boreau,</hi> and Letters to the General <hi>Martine</hi> and him, entreating them to write him back word with all expedition whatsoever news was stirring, which they thought might import the King of <hi>Syams,</hi> his Lordships, or his own notice, that so they might govern themselves accordingly. By her also he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises, that he had ordered Mr. <hi>How</hi> on his return from <hi>Moco,</hi> which he hoped would be in <hi>August,</hi> or <hi>September</hi> next, to touch at their Port, and deliver Monsieur <hi>Des Landres</hi> twenty thousand <hi>Dollars</hi> for his account, concerning the dispose whereof, he would write to him more fully by another conveyance, which was to follow in <hi>March</hi> next. By this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, also his Invitatory Letter for sending out a permission ship, was contradicted once again in a Cover to Mr. <hi>Heath,</hi> to be forwarded along with the Packet to <hi>Madrass.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>in order to the promised <hi>Pullicherry</hi> expedition in <hi>March</hi> next, Mr. <hi>White</hi> having long since cast his eye on <hi>Don Joseph d' Haeredias</hi> new ship, and vowed that let what would come, that ship should fall into his hand, and no bodies else; He now effects his design after this manner. He frames and orders to be translated into <hi>Portuguees</hi> a Summons to the <hi>Don,</hi> to surrender his ship to the King of <hi>Syam</hi> for the security of the Pagodoes three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand he owed him on the <hi>Metchlepatam</hi> Voyage; pretending (though there was no such thing) a fresh and strict order from the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> so to do, and that if he would take two hundred <hi>Cattees</hi> of Silver for her, first deducting what he owed the King, the <hi>super</hi> Amount should be paid him whensoever he pleased, if not the King expected that he should immediately pay in his Debt, which having (as he said) positive orders forthwith to recover of him, to sell her out right on the terms aforesaid, or if not, that if he would let him have her for a Voyage to <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> he would discount part of his Debt to the King for her freight, and in the interim use his utmost endeavour at Court to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate, and if possible divert the Kings Demands for the rest. The poor <hi>Don</hi> quite sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at this unlooked for harshness, condescended to the last proposition, because he could not avoid it, and the ship was immediately ordered to be sitted.</p>

               <p>The first of this month came an Answer from the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> to Mr. <hi>White,</hi> concerning Mr. <hi>Thredders</hi> Affair, not at all sutable to his expectation; for he writes word, that 'twas very indiscreet to grow jealous on every occasion of those he emplov'd, nor could it found well for him to deal so unhandsomly by Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> as to detain his Estate without some more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable ground, than a bare possibility, that himself might be knavishly dealt with; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he could not comply with Mr. <hi>Thredders</hi> request (which arrived him the very day he dispacht this Letter to the <hi>Shabander,</hi> in paying him money, instead of Tinn, nor had Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> any reason to expect it, having made his Contract for Tinn) yet he posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively charged the <hi>Shabander</hi> to deliver him the 120 <hi>Bahars</hi> of that Commodity, and let Mr. <hi>Thredder</hi> look out for Freight, where he could meet with it, that not being his business, which when the <hi>Shabander</hi> had perused, and given me to file, well, says he, I shall have Tinn enough for M. <hi>Thredder,</hi> before he'll meet with a ship to freight it on.</p>
               <p>In this Letter came also a very severe check to the <hi>Shabander,</hi> (whereas he indeed had expected a commendation of his care) that he should offer to send the Kings Subjects out of the Land, without order from Court, and that too upon a matter of such weighty concernment, as to keep possession of an Island, which he had no assurance was properly belonging to, or within the dominions of his Majesty, by which act, he had not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Lives of so many of the Kings Majestyy's Subjects to the rage of the <hi>English,</hi> if they should come there with a design to fortifie, but for ought he knew laid the foundation of a War with his Neighbour Princes, whose property it should appear to be, and therefore he strictly charg'd him, immediately to dispatch a small Vessel to bring back <hi>Opra Qua,</hi> and the twenty <hi>Lulongs</hi> with all their necessaries, and be more cantious for the future, how he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in such weighty affairs, without first advising up to Court.</p>
               <p>In observance of this Order, <hi>Anthony Highoe</hi> was dispatcht the next day, in a small sloop, who was to take <hi>Elves</hi> in his way at the Bar of <hi>Sirian,</hi> and they two, to go and fetch back the Soldiers from <hi>Negraes,</hi> but to leave the Inscription there.</p>
               <p>The third of this month, <hi>Morgan</hi> in the <hi>Advice</hi> sloop brought into Port the <hi>Nossa Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hora d' Monte, d' San Thome, Gabriel d' Rosayro Pilot,</hi> whom <hi>Cropley,</hi> going from <hi>Sirian</hi> Bar, to <hi>Negraes,</hi> to carry the <hi>Lulong,</hi> and water his ship, before he put for the Coast of <hi>Gingerlee,</hi> had met with, and being ordered expresly by the <hi>Shabander,</hi> not to take notice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Passes, in any ships he should meet with, not manned with all <hi>English</hi> men, had sent her under the charge of <hi>Morgan;</hi> On her came Mr. <hi>Noden,</hi> from whom the <hi>Shabander</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding how Affairs went at the Coast and Bay; he was at first fully determin'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and make prize of the ship; but at length, through my earnest intercession for her releasement, using those very Arguments for his clearing of her, which he brought for the reasonableness of his proceeding to condemn her: He was prevailed with, to think it his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:207011:13"/>wisest course to dismiss her again, without waiting order from <hi>Syam,</hi> yet because he would appear zealous for the Kings interest, he takes out all the <hi>Madapollam</hi> Passengers, paying their <hi>Tallicooly</hi> to the Captain, and makes them the Kings slaves, and buyes as many more as the free Merchant, or any of the Officers of the ship were willing to part with, and so forcing the Commander to withdraw a protest, which he had made against <hi>Cropley, Triggs,</hi> &amp;c. in behalf of the owners of the ship for damages, that had and might accrue, and in behalf of the honourable <hi>English</hi> Company, for the contempt of their Pass, he supplyed him with fresh Provisions for his money, water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so suffered him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for <hi>Pegu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eighth of this month came the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> Letter concerning Mr. <hi>Graunts</hi> ship, wherein he advised Mr. <hi>White</hi> to be very cautious in his proceeding to the condemnation of her, since things of that nature might prove of very bad consequence, if inconsiderately rush'd upon, and though he would not have the King lose any thing of his Right, yet he would not have his authority improv'd in every little circumstance to the height of rigour, and therefore if the fault did not appear to be designedly, and notoriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontive of the Kings Authority, and the Established Rules of the Port it might be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to exact some reasonable Fine from the <hi>Nocquedah,</hi> and dismiss the ship, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay, that she might not lose her passage to the <hi>Bay,</hi> and so perhaps have occasion given them to complain of as hard usage, as if totally confiscated.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>White</hi> designing the ship for <hi>Atcheen</hi> in <hi>March</hi> next with a lading of Rice, had now laid her on shoar, new fitted her, and new masted her, and was resolv'd not to part with her, but seize upon both her and Cargo, which consisting of Coppar, Tin, Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Ganja and <hi>China</hi> Ware, to the amount of one hundred ninty two <hi>Cattees Mergen,</hi> according to the <hi>Nocquedahs</hi> Invoice of prime Cost at <hi>Atcheen,</hi> he thought would not be amiss to send on the <hi>Don</hi>'s ship to <hi>Pullicherry</hi> for his own Account; whom he designed should sail the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> so there was nothing more to be said concerning either ship or cargo; Mr. <hi>White</hi> pretending both to the <hi>Nocquedah</hi> and Pilot, that the King had seiz'd upon all, and on the other hand he thought it not convenient to let the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> know any thing farther of the matter, but that he cleared and dismist her; by which means not only the <hi>Moors,</hi> but poor <hi>Arthur Seymour</hi> must lose all, and the Pilot his Sallary, though he paid the rest of the men their wages, because he would not be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually haunted by them, and refused the payment of the Pilot, because he happened to say, <hi>Morgan</hi> was a second <hi>Tunis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tenth of this month, <hi>Morgan</hi> in the <hi>Advice</hi>-Sloop, under pretence of going to chase the <hi>Salitres</hi> off the Coast to the Southward, was privately dispatch'd to the <hi>Nin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combers,</hi> with a Cargo, which was supposed very proper for barter there.</p>
               <p>The twentieth of this month, the <hi>Mergen</hi> Frigat came unlookt for from <hi>Negraes,</hi> on pretence they could not meet with water enough to recrute them for the Coast design. Now <hi>Cropley</hi> owned to me, that he was not in want of water, or any thing else, but receiving orders to publish and sign such a Declaration at St. <hi>Thoma,</hi> to some of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Madrass,</hi> as might (for ought he knew) one time or other hazard his Neck, and that too upon the single hand writing of Mr. <hi>White;</hi> he was so far from resolving to execute that his order, that had it not been for the sake of his Wife and Children at <hi>Mergen,</hi> and that he was afraid the <hi>Shabander</hi> would utterly ruine them, He would have gone directly to <hi>Madrass,</hi> and have surrendred up the ship to the Company, for he was very sure those proceedings of Mr. <hi>White</hi> could never end well, either for himself, or those that served under him. Mr. <hi>White</hi> though he had ever after this no good will for <hi>Cropley,</hi> as thinking his pretence of not finding water at <hi>Negraes,</hi> to be a forgery, yet he was very glad of her return, for ever since Mr. <hi>Nodens</hi> arrival, he had been very doubtfull of <hi>Resolutions</hi> safety, and whereas before for want of men, he had endeavoured to wave the <hi>Persia</hi> Voyage, now he thought it a good opportunity to carryon another design, under pretence that this ship was proper for the <hi>Persia</hi> Voyage, as being a good failer and well man'd, and that she might be fitted, and victualled time enough to proceed in the latter end of <hi>March;</hi> and gain her passage, by going to the South-ward of the <hi>Line;</hi> under which colour, when once she was got ready, and well furnished with Provisions, and all things necessary, without any suspicion of the Natives, it would be no difficult matter to flam them, as he said with a hundred pretences, to excuse her proceeding, and so keep her in a constant readiness (provided the ship <hi>Resolution</hi> should miscarry) all the monsoon, for any emergency whatsoever, nor was <hi>Cropley</hi> to know, but that he was to proceed upon her to <hi>Persia,</hi> untill she was got into a sailing posture, and then he would pitch upon some other person to Command her.</p>
               <p>Now it is to be noted that Mr. <hi>Phillip Noden</hi> before his departure hence, gave Mr. <hi>White</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain information of the Hon. Companies intentions, ere long to make demands from the King of <hi>Syam</hi> of Reparation for damages themselves, and sundry Merchants under their protection had received through the rash and unwarrantable proceedings of the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> his chief Minister of State, and that Mr. <hi>Robert Freeman</hi> was the person desgned for the City of <hi>Syam,</hi> on that affair, and also that they were much disgusted with Mr. <hi>White</hi> himself, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so active an instrument in the prejudices they had received; this (having been as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:207011:14"/>hinted, closely urged by me as an argument for the said ships being cleared, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asserting that in my opinion to add this extravagance to all the rest, would be like a mans willfully precipitating himself into danger, and then putting out his Eyes because he would not see it) did so work with Mr. <hi>White,</hi> that he not only shewed some respect, as aforesaid to the Companies Pass, but also after her dismission, and a more calm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the present state of matters, put him upon a more intense and impartial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and consideration of what he had done, during his <hi>Shabandership,</hi> that might give the Company any occasion of offence, or just ground of complaint against him, saying, that as the Company could not have pitcht upon so sit a person as Mr. <hi>Freeman</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their grievances at Court, nor one that could more cunningly insinuate himself into the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi>'s favour, so no man in <hi>India,</hi> he was sure, was either so capable, or so much inclined to do him a prejudice at Court, wherefore he ordered me to peruse all his books of Registers, Letters sent or received, orders, instructions, dispatches, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Papers might more or less relate to his management of Affairs in the King of <hi>Syams</hi> Breach with <hi>Golcondah</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> and to make my punctual, and impartial Remarks of every individual passage I should happen to meet with, that to me might seem any way ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unwarrantable, or but tending to disoblige the Company, or any of their Servants on the other side.</p>
               <p>The dispatch of several Vessels abroad being then in hand, a good part of the month was spent before I had leisure to apply my self to the observance of that order, but when I had at length represented to him, what to me appeared of most importance, relating to the Premises, he declared himself very apprehensive of the danger he was in, having never had any Commission from the King of <hi>Syam</hi> for making War upon the Kings of <hi>Golcondah</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> or their Subjects; and that he had no other warrant for so doing, but bare word of mouth from the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> or which was of no more validity in Law, perhaps an approbation of taking that course in a private Letter, and that he did not like it, when his Lordship in <hi>September,</hi> last refused to grant him a Commission, <hi>Ex post facto,</hi> though he did so earnestly desire it, which he took for an argument, that his Lordship being apprehensive of the of these Commotions, was resolv'd, if possible, to keep his own neck out of the Collar. And continued Mr. <hi>White</hi> to me, 'tis only for the discovery of such over-sights, and slips as might prove of dangerous consequence, that I spoke to you to do what you have done, and as you have, <hi>primo limine,</hi> met that grand one, my want of a Commission, our business must be to study some remedy for it. And now, says he, what do you think best to do in this case? Upon which I replyed, that a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of such moment, would require time for a deliberate and well digested answer; no says he, but tell me your present thoughts of the matter. Then Sir, said I, I know not at present what to advise you, other than, that if the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> be sincerely (as by the kind invitation you two days since received from him to live with him at <hi>Syam,</hi> he pretends to be) your friend, and that you have acted nothing in relation to that War, but either what he was privy to before you did it, or approved it when done, or if once offended at you for it, hath since been throughly reconciled to you again; you, once more, notwithstanding his former refusal, plainly lay open to him your over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight in not having a Commission to act by, when you first undertook the concern, and that to obviate all prejudices that may at any time hereafter, for want of one, accrue to you from the pretences of your own Country-men, you do now request that one may be granted you, with which he may, if he pleases, safely favour you, without any hazard of damage to himself. And in the interim, for as much as it will be <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ship will be dispatched from the Coast for <hi>Syam,</hi> I would advise you to lay aside the <hi>Pullicherry</hi> design, and send the <hi>Dons</hi> Ship laden with Rice, as a present to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Council at <hi>Madrass</hi> for the relief of their Garrison, where you hear there is at present a very sharp Famine, which act would in my opinion so seasonably take off the edge of their ill opinions concerning you, that in all probability they may alter their minds, and totally desist from either making any complaints against you at this Court, or summoning you hence. To the former proposal, Mr. <hi>White</hi> replied, he knew the King would not now grant him one, and that the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> would do no such thing, without first acquainting his Majesty, nor was he willing the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> should take any further alarm from the discovery of any fears in him, saying that it repented him very much that he had already acquainted him with so much of Mr. <hi>Nodens</hi> news, for, continued he, though he only, t'other day invited me up to Court, I am afraid on that news, he will summon me up, but to prevent that, I'll e'en make it my businese to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what I have written him concerning it, and so keep him as secure, and unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the matter as I can, least I become the object of his jealousie; and so be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as I was the last year. To the second he answered, that he could be glad with all his heart to stand fair in the opinions of the <hi>Madrass</hi> Blades, at the cost of three or four hundred <hi>Tonns</hi> of Rice, but to send it at such a juncture as this, when they were plotting and resolving his prejudice, would look too like a peace of precariousness, and fear of them; and rather than do any thing that might expose him to such thoughts among any of them, he would run the hazard of the worst they could do to him.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:207011:14"/>
               <p> From this we past on to many other Instances, which seem'd to be as well not Justifiable to his Master the King, and his Friend the Lord <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> as prejudicial to the <hi>English</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and reflective on their Honour; in which I used all sincerity and freedom to give him the truth of my Opinion, back't with the best Reasons I had to confirm it; some of which he was pleased to censure, as the product of too much timorousness in his behalf, who was not wholly unacquainted with those <hi>Salvoes,</hi> which he reserved as yet in his own Breast, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever exigence, or emergency, but said, he would in their proper season communicate them to me, and for that time he told me he was very highly satisfied to find me deal so freely, and candidly with him, and that had been some, if not the major part of his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that he never, until he met with me, found one that had Courage enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve to his face any one Enterprize, that ever he propos'd to attempt, or discover'd to them when he had effected, and says he, theres not a Man upon the place, that has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of a Goose; here's Mr. <hi>Burneby</hi> is fit to converse with no body, but his Crim. <hi>Catwall,</hi> and take delight in being the Town Pimp, and disposing of all the Whores to any body that wants one, or keeps company with a parcel of Sailors, that over a Bowl of Punch, will lye worshipping him up, till he thinks himself a Petty Prince among them, and in the mean time near minds the main chance, nay, he's so soft a fellow, as to let his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cheat him to his face, and run away with the Perquisites of his Office; for I my self have offered him Fifty <hi>Cattees</hi> a year, for that he never made Five <hi>Cattees</hi> of, since he came to the place, and to tell him a secret is the same thing, as to publish it about the Town with a Drum, or take a Woman into Council; therefore since I intend to hide nothing from you, I expect your Secrecy, and not only give you the liberty, but enjoyn you on all occasions, that may come under Debate, to deal plainly with me, and speak your own sense of things, and you shall be no loser by it, for I foresee there will be no small bustle, especially since Mr. <hi>Yale,</hi> the mighty Man of Power at <hi>Madrass,</hi> has been so highly exasperated about the Jewel Affair, and I am apt to think, disgusted at me, because I have alwayes declined a Correspondence of Trade with him; which no doubt he will, if he can revenge, (though I cannot apprehend how they should have any Order so soon out of <hi>England</hi>) under the Masque of the Companies Demands, for the wrongs they pretend to have received by his Lordships ill Conduct; in which, 'tis impossible I should escape scotfree, (for with him, and <hi>Robin Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> together, the Devil will not be able to deal) unless I take some timely course to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent falling in their Clutches; and continued he, I have in view four several ways to keep out of their reach, which I would have you well consider of, and in eight or four dayes time, give me your Opinion, which of them, (all things well weighed) seems to you most conducive to the security of my Interest, or Reputation, or both; and in the mean time, I my self will make it my business to consider them.</p>

               <p>In few days after her dispatch, Mr. <hi>Tracyes</hi> unlookt for return with the <hi>Armenians</hi> small Ship from <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> would not give her entertainment, together with the fresh news of the Companies designs to break with the King of <hi>Syam,</hi> confirmed also <hi>Via Bengala,</hi> by a <hi>French</hi> Sloop, which arriv'd the same day with <hi>Tracy,</hi> and brought Mr. <hi>White</hi> a startling Letter from the President and Council at <hi>Madrass,</hi> Dated in <hi>April</hi> last, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his usage of the black Merchants on their return from <hi>Pegu,</hi> but Mr. <hi>White,</hi> under such apprehensions, that nothing could scarcely please him, that was not precipitantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd on; whereupon delivering all his Letters to me, Here, says he, peruse them: You'l

               <p>In this Pacquet he was as good as his word, to contradict the news Mr. <hi>Noden</hi> brought, and he had (as he pretended) rashly given an Account of to his Lordship, alledging, that by his Advices from <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> though Mounsieur <hi>Martin</hi> had ungentilely, and no way su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the treatment their people found at this Court, refused the Saint <hi>John,</hi> yet the true reason was not either his care of disobliging the <hi>English,</hi> because they proclaimed, or threatned War with this Crown; for 'twas no such thing, or his good inclinations to the King of <hi>Syams,</hi> or his Lordships Interest, which made him not detain, what he had not at present strength enough to protect, but merely because his Lordship had consign'd the Ship solely to his Son in Law, Mounsieur <hi>Des Landres,</hi> without taking notice of him, who as he was General, took it for an affront, and that he had now receiv'd good assurances, that the reports of the Companies successes in <hi>Bengala,</hi> or intentions of sending any Ships hither, or to <hi>Syam,</hi> were equally false, though 'twas true, the Company had broken out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a War in the <hi>Bay,</hi> but had no better success than (what commonly, as he said, attends all their Enterprizes) to be forc't out of their Factories, and in a fair way to lose all their footing there.</p>
               <p>When these Letters were finished, I put him in mind of the Commission, supposing he had forgot it, to which he answered no, arid bad me keep it by me, until he called for it,</p>
               <p>What fell next in course, was the forming of his Resolutions, what course to take, and when he askt what, I thought of the proposals he had given me to consider of, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him with this following Answer, which I had kept by me, in a readiness for several dayes.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>All which I present not to your view with any design to disturb your Spirits, but to let you see, how plain I will be to one, whom I esteem my friend, and I really believe, the most of these Instances, if not more than these, would be severely urg'd against you, to your extreme hazard, when once discover'd, and 'twould be impossible to conceal them, after your surrender of your present employment, and repair to Court. I need urge no more, than put you in mind of the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> Predecessor, whose Story I had from your own mouth, though I might add the many Enemies you have in this Country, both <hi>Moors</hi> and Natives, who lye upon the advantage against you.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. As to your second proposal, besides the unhandsomness of the act in it self, if you can effect it, (as 'tis true, your Power being in a manner unlimited over the Natives, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to go a great way in such a design) it is odds, if it prove not so far from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing you any esteem with your own Country-men, that 'twould not rather expose you to the scorn of all that pretend to either Honour, Honesty, or Policy; and subject the whole Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to the reflection of all other <hi>European</hi> Nations, as well as the jealousie of all <hi>Indian</hi> Princes.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. As to the third, I suppose you only mention'd it to try, whether I could believe you a Man of such Principles; for I dare affirm, though you are well read, both in Books and Men, yet you cannot bring one instance, wherein Acts of such a nature have not at one time or other met with their just reward, or the Actors, at least been branded with Eternal infamy.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. As to the last of the four, I look upon it as a Course, not altogether so discommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, or at least, not so desperate as any of the former, but of great difficulty, for 'twill be <hi>August</hi> before you can well be in a readiness to go from hence, and then you may expect a Man of War here; or if you can get ready to go in <hi>July,</hi> and hide amongst the Islands to the Southward, until the <hi>Monsoon</hi> presents to get off this Coast, yet, your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration must necessarily be so extraordinary great, that the whole Country will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and you may perhaps be unawares prevented on that hand; so that if I might advise, I look upon it most conducive both to your Reputation, and Interest at home, and here, immediately to adjust your Account with the King to the last of <hi>February,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

Petition his Majesty to dispense with your retirement from his service, In the mean time, let the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> Frigat be made ready, and so you may early enough, in the latter end of <hi>April</hi> fetch <hi>Madrass,</hi> where when it appears, that nothing has accru'd through your means to the prejudice of the Honourable Company otherwise, than as an accidental consequence of the King of <hi>Syams</hi> Commands, (but to make that appear, you must not omit to procure the Commission) you will no doubt not only stop the mouths of a great many, that otherways you will in all probability find widely open to blast your Name with all the detraction, which the sufferings of some, and the envy of others can dictate; but also prevent a mass of inconveniencies, which at this distance you may not perhaps distinctly foresee.

                        </p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>All the Reply Mr. <hi>White</hi> gave to this Paper at this time, putting it after he had read it into his Pocket, was, That he was going to <hi>Mary Leslyes,</hi> and it should not be long before he resolved on something or other.</p>
               <p>The next day he calls for me, and tells me, it must now be his whole business to get what Money he could into his hands, that he must now play at small games, rather than stand out: He would take the <hi>French</hi> Mans Cargo off his hands, which amounted <hi>per Invoice</hi> to Four Thousand Rupees, and give him Seven Thousand for it, and he doubted not, but to double his Money in a few dayes time, for he would make the Merchants take it off his hands at his own Rates; and besides, those that would have any Butter, or Oyl, should take a proportion of Cloth off his hands, by which means he hoped to get rid of a great part of the Rubbidge that lay by him: To all which I had little to say.</p>
               <p>But after this his Discourse, hapned a passage, which so far amazed me, that it put me by inquiring of him the reason of it, and 'twas thus. This day the <hi>Bengala</hi> Ship, (which formerly was called the <hi>Bom Success,</hi> but now by him named the <hi>Resistance</hi>) being to sail for <hi>Atcheen</hi> with Rice, which she was to unlade into the <hi>Derrea Dowlet,</hi> and with all possible expedition return directly hither, with whatsoever Gold Captain <hi>Russel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mallet</hi> should have in readiness, about two, or three hours before the Ship was to sail, he bids me fetch the Commission aforementioned, and in my presence, making marks with a Pencil, where the <hi>Oyea,</hi> and the <hi>Coromocon</hi> should fix their Seals over the writing (The Commission being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten length way, on a sheet of large Paper, and begun about the lower half of the sheet) he orders <hi>Lewis Lobo</hi> his <hi>Okone Tuzerkon</hi> to carry it to the <hi>Coromocon</hi> for them, to affix each man his Seal, and tell them it was the dispatch of the <hi>Bengala</hi> Ship, according to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from <hi>Syam,</hi> which I knowing to be so palpable a falsehood, trembled to imagine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this might issue, fully concluding that the requiring the <hi>Coromocon</hi> to affix the Seals of their respective Offices, to such a Paper, wherein nothing was written, that they were to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and yet any thing more might be written afterwards, above those Seals in their own Language, without their privity, was a clear argument of some dark designs in Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and that he never intended to acquaint his friend, the Lord <hi>Phaulkon</hi> with it. When the <hi>Tuzerkon</hi> brought it back seal'd as above directed, 'twas again committed to my keeping, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Mr. <hi>White</hi> should call for it, which, pursuant to his orders, I took care to put up, but with more regret than I can express, to find my self also in some measure slurr'd, by being privy to so mean and disingenuous an Action.</p>
               <p>The 23d of this Moneth Mr. <hi>White</hi> calls me into his Lodging-Room, and tells me to this effect, Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> I have considered your motion for my going to <hi>Madrass,</hi> but alas, those Arguments you urge from the stopping of peoples mouths, are not of weight enough, to induce me to take that Course, nor do I know what you mean by that Mass of Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, which may insue, upon my taking any other; if God send me well to <hi>Europe,</hi> I shall have as fair play at the Law for my Money, as my Adversaries; and besides, I have by the <hi>Dons</hi> Ship, <hi>Via Pullicherry</hi> ordered, you know, the payment of <hi>Freemans</hi> Debt, if he will be content with the Principal, so that his Mouth will be stopt, and I know of no Debts that I am owing to any body else on that side, so that I expect the less Clamours to follow me to <hi>England:</hi> To which I reply'd, Sir, Methinks what you now say, should be rather an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you to go to <hi>Madrass,</hi> for if Mr. <hi>Freeman</hi> be satisfied, and not your Enemy, since you value no body, but Mr. <hi>Yale</hi> and him, there may be some hopes that Mr. <hi>Yale</hi> may also be made in time your friend too; however, if Arguments drawn from the probability of ensuing inconveniency, are of no validity, I have only one more from the Conveniency that will attend your going now to <hi>Madrass,</hi> to offer to your consideration, and so leave it to your own Judgment, to determine.</p>
               <p>As you have designed to turn your <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>South Sea</hi> Adventures upon <hi>Clong,</hi> nay, making your self satisfaction out of the King's effects, laden on your Ship for <hi>Moco</hi> (though by you I must needs say, it will not look well, to leave the Two Hundred Cattees which the King
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:207011:16"/>lent you unsatisfied) so you may not only at <hi>Atcheen,</hi> in your way take the proceed of the <hi>Bengala</hi> ships Cargo, and your part of what laden on the <hi>Derrea Dowlet,</hi> but at <hi>Madrass</hi> your self receive the produce of the <hi>Moco</hi> ships Cargo, which, how well 'tis worth your staying for at the Coast, I need not tell you; nay you will be there too before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the <hi>Dons</hi> ship from <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> and so may receive there the proceed of what's sent on her, whereas if you conclude upon going for <hi>Europe</hi> from hence, and an <hi>English</hi> man of War should happen to come hither in the month of <hi>May,</hi> or <hi>June</hi> (as from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drass</hi> you know it may be done very well) I do not apprehend how you can well escape going with him thither, against your inclinations, and to your far greater prejudice than if you prevented their sending you any Summons.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>White,</hi> with an extraordinay concernedness told me, that I talk'd like one that knew but the shel and outside of things, and that if he was sure, going to <hi>Madrass</hi> would keep him from going to Hell, he would choose to be damned rather then go thither to be laugh'd at by <hi>Yale</hi> and <hi>Freeman,</hi> and, continued he, if ever a ship of the King of <hi>England</hi> comes to this Port, before I am gone, the Commander shall find me as civil to him, as he can be to me, but if once he comes to tell me that I must go with him, and pretends the Kings authority here, by the living God, I'll pistol him with my own hands, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wipe my breech with his Commission.</p>
               <p>Upon this I offered to withdraw, and was got into the next room, when he called me again; come, says he, I talk what I would do if an <hi>English</hi> man of War should find me here,, but you need not fear, but I'll be gone out of their way, time enough for <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> I am resolv'd, and I think to <hi>Persia,</hi> and so over Land will be the best course, but whether that way, or by Sea, is time enough to conclude, when I am in a readiness for either. As to the <hi>Moco</hi> ship, I'll sell her, and her Cargo to any man for three <hi>Tekols,</hi> and the <hi>Pullicherry</hi> ship for three more, for 'tis impossible either of them should escape, and therefore I value them not a straw. I am most concerned for <hi>Lesly,</hi> I am afraid he'll be snapt upon the Coast, and he is the only man for my turn on this occasion, for <hi>Cropley,</hi> I know is neither well affected to me, nor fit for the business, because of his Wife and Family, and besides whoever else, I shall for want of <hi>Lesly</hi> be forced to employ, yet I am so embarast with that Family, that I must of necessity carry my <hi>Mary</hi> (for so he used al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to call Madam <hi>Lesly</hi>) and her young bantlings along with me, nor can I with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, well leave Mr. <hi>Russel.</hi> Well but Sir, said I, what will become of the <hi>Raja</hi> Mr. <hi>Burneby,</hi> will you leave him here exposed to the fury of the Natives, or at best to the Kings pleasure; God damn him, replyed Mr. <hi>White,</hi> I dare not trust him with secret of such importance, I had as good publish it thorough the Town with a Gong, and besides what tie am I under to take care of him, has not he eyes in his head to foresee the danger, let him shift for himself; yet I do not know, it may be when I am just ready to go, I may take him with me, and that is time enough to tell him, half a dozen silver Plates and Spoons, and a few cloths, with it may be fourty or fifty <hi>Cattees</hi> in Money makes up his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, I need not much fear his over-lading my ship. Thus he broke off at this time.</p>
               <p>The twenty sixth of the month, 1687. he comes to me in the writing Room, and finding Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> absent, begins to this effect: The <hi>Mergen</hi> Frigat shall take in all the Tin, and I'll continue my pretence of sending her on the Kings Errand to <hi>Persia,</hi> with the <hi>Colwans,</hi> that so the Country people may not take notice of my putting extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions aboard her, and three or four days hence we will go and sound all about the Islands to the Southward (as I was before designing, if you remember) under pretence of visiting the Fortifications at <hi>Nocklay</hi> (not that there are any such things as Fortifications there, capable to keep a Tyger from carrying a Buffalo out of the compound, nor indeed is there any occasion for any there) so under that colour I will make choice of a convenient place to hide the Ship in, until the <hi>Monsoon</hi> will permit my proceeding, and at our return from sounding, I would have you draw up all the Garrison, and Port accounts, for I am resolved to disband all the Soldiers, and discharge all the Seamen, reserving only such in Pay as shall be fittest for my design, and for the more plausible doing it, I would have you also draw up a Declaration to be put up at my Gate, and the Court of Guards, signifying the Kings pleasure, respecting the stating and Limitation of Foreigners wages, imployed in his Service for the future, which I would have you to state according to the <hi>Bankoke</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, for that is so low, that I know they will disband themselves, rather than accept it; nor will the blame appear to them, to lie in me. Besides, though whilst I had occasion for men to do my turn, I gave them extraordinary encouragement, yet that being serv'd, I will not be to seek for reasons to satisfie his honour with my disbanding the Soldiers, and if what I write to him about it will not prevent a broad-side of Scolding from him, I can bear it well enough, for before it can reach me, it will have lost its force. The Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers I know when once Disbanded, will soon disperse, and I shall have the fewer obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of my preparations, and rather than they should stay here to take notice of what I do, I will find a way underhand to encourage them to go up to <hi>Syam,</hi> and then give them <hi>Tarraes</hi> to pass to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> but clap a stop upon their proceedings any further: which besides the Convenience of being rid of so many eyes, will save an unnecessary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to my self, and give me an opportunty (if there should be any occasion) to do my
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:207011:17"/>business better with Natives, against whosoever shall arise to oppose me in my escape, for after the ship is once hid amongst the Islands, which the Natives shall not know where she is, I will always keep the Barge and Sloope <hi>Robin</hi> in readiness before my door, and a dozen of Country Boats, divided into four Squadrons, continually out upon the scout, and so whensoever an <hi>English</hi> Man of War comes in sight, I will set fire of the Town, and immediately repair to my ship, where I will give them leave to find me out, if they can, for they had as good look for a Needle in a Bottle of Hay, as for me, if I get but two days start before them. In the mean time before we go a sounding, I would have you pack in the new Chests now made, every thing of value in my House, and numbering the Chests, take an exact Invoice of every thing, valuing it at the real worth in this place, that so I may know both what I have, and where to look for it, upon any occasion, or if any unexpected accident should happen, the Invoice one time or other may stand me in some stead: which I answered should be done, but I desired he would please to be present at the pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rating of them, for his better satisfaction, he said he would be the next day at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to go about it.</p>
               <p>The next day, being Easter-day was improper for any business of such a nature; and Mr. <hi>White</hi> making a noble Entertainment for all the <hi>Europeans</hi> on the shoar, was very liberal to all his immediate Servants, both White and Black, from the highest to the lowest; to me in particular he gave two pieces of Silk very rich, telling me at the same time, that he designed a more considerable Token of his kindness for me in a short while, and that he gave me that only in course, because he was minded to give all his Servants somewhat on that Festival, which he said he had designed to have done on the fifth of the month, his Birth day, had he not forgotten it.</p>
               <p>On Munday the twenty eighth, he asked me if I was ready to go about packing of his Goods, as he had spoke to me on Saturday, telling me that from <hi>Nocklay</hi> he was intended to go to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> and thence to the hot waters, and in his way call the <hi>Serpacones</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, what they had done in examining all the Gardens, and fruit Trees, and that he hop'd to get a hundred and fifty or two hundred <hi>Cattees</hi> out of the Garden Rents; yet before he went for <hi>Europe,</hi> however he would turn all the remains of his Salt that lay at <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassery</hi> upon the <hi>Muong</hi> at eight Tales <hi>per Quoyen,</hi> which was two Tales <hi>per Quoyen</hi> less then the Kings price in the Articles; and says he, I will make the <hi>Coromocon</hi> do it, by distributing it among the <hi>Queans</hi> and <hi>Nayes,</hi> so that I shall have little, or no trouble, nor shall they know but the Salt is the Kings, so I shall receive all my Money at a lump from <hi>Opra Ballat,</hi> for they dare as well be damn'd as refuse to take it, when 'tis to raise Money for defraying the Garrison, and Port charges, and if it cannot be all collected before I Disband the Soldiers, yet it will be secure enough, when once <hi>Opra Ballat</hi> becomes obliged to get it in, and I shall have money enough otherways to pay off the Soldiers at my return from <hi>Tenassery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this discourse, observing me to look somewhat dejectedly, quoth Mr. <hi>White</hi> to me; Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> what's the matter with you, are you not well? I answering, yes, God be thanked, I was very well in health: I perceive, says he, then you are dissatisfied in your mind at something or other: pray be plain with me, and tell me what it is? To which I replyed, Sir, 'tis very true, I am much dissatisfied, both in respect of you and my self, in respect of my self, because as you have been always kind to me, so my circumstances are such, that I cannot manifests my Obligation to you in such a manner as I plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, your occasions will require, and perhaps you may expect from me, without my extreme prejudice on many scores, the main ones are these. If I go with you for <hi>Europe,</hi> and you should have the good fortune to escape Interception, I shall leave my concerns in the <hi>Bay,</hi> at such uncertainties, and expose my self so much to the censure of all our Country-men in <hi>India,</hi> who are many of them, but too apt to put the worst Construction upon every persons proceedings, that hath been but once unfortunate, that I much question, whether on my return to these parts again, I should be ever able to retrieve my Reputation, and if I continue with you in the sphere I now move, untill your departure hence, and then stay behind you, what can I expect but to be exposed, if not to the rage and fury of the Natives, yet to the Kings and your Friend, the Lord <hi>Phaulkons</hi> indignation, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been privy to your design'd escape, and lastly if any Kings ship should arrive before you are gone hence, and you continue in the mind to oppose or cut them off that come upon her, how can I, preserving my Allegiance unblemished, concur with you in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an attempt. Now in respect of your self I am dissatisfied, because I am apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive the course you have resolved on will not prove so conducive to your aims, nor Period in so satisfactory an issue, as I believe you propose to your self: Wherefore I desire you would please to discharge me your Service, that so I may live unconcerned, untill some opportunity presents of going hence; upon which he told me that sooner than detain me, in his Service against my will, he would not only dismiss me but give me a small Sloop to carry me to <hi>Bengala,</hi> or whithersoever I would go; But I must have patience untill he had got his ship secured out of the way. I then desired him to permit me forthwith to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up my charge of the Cash, alledging that I met with so many Avocations from his other business, by being obliged to attend every fellow that came to pay in, or receive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:207011:17"/>so small a sum, that 'twas a great trouble to me, whereupon he immediately after perusal of the Cash-Book, and comparing it with his own Notes, my Receipts, and the Cash then instock, under writ the Account accepted, and delivered both the Cash and Cash Book to Mr. <hi>John Turner</hi>'s custody and care.</p>
               <p>This afternoon we packt up all his Plate (except a little for daily use) Rich Silks, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, Sea-Books, and instruments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we were about it, he voluntarily began a discourse to me, to this purpose, that he did not forget the promise that he had made to me of one thousand <hi>Rupees</hi> extraordinary, besides all my Wages, and that if I would but continue with him, and goes only to <hi>Persia,</hi> he would give me the Sloop <hi>Robin</hi> (for he should go in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to <hi>Bussora</hi>) freely, and not only so, but I should find him a great deal better to me then all this: To which I replyed, I did not doubt his making good his promise in the least, and I hoped he was well satisfied with the Reasons I had given him before Dinner of my unwillingness to proceed with him, either for <hi>Europe,</hi> or any whither else, except for <hi>Madrass,</hi> for things now being likely to fall out unsutable to my former expectations, he could not well blame me, if I desired to be at my own liberty, and live retired, though perhaps it might not prove so much to my advantage, as to be in constant pay, and that however, I would never be backward in any friendly assistance, he might desire from me, only preserving my self free from interfering with the designs he had entred into, relating to his removal hence; He then told me, that I should be at my own choice, and at my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to leave him, when I pleased, and all that he desired of me, was to accompany him to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> and help to settle his particular Accounts with the Merchants. To this I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consented.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the twenty ninth, he orders me once more to bring him the Commission, which the <hi>Coromocon,</hi> as already said, had sealed, and sending for his <hi>Okonta,</hi> with another <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammer</hi> (an <hi>Escrivan,</hi> whom to my knowledge, I had never seen before) into the writing Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Mr. <hi>White</hi> shuts the door, and dictating to the <hi>Okonta</hi> in <hi>Moors</hi> the contents of the Commission, he orders him to interpret it into the <hi>Syam</hi> Language to the <hi>Escrivan,</hi> and bid him write it first in a <hi>Bapote,</hi> and afterwards fair over on the same paper, above the Seals, and the <hi>English</hi> writing. Mr. <hi>White</hi> himself Ruling the lines with a Lead Pencil, at such distance as he thought convenient to contain what the Fellow was to write. The <hi>Okonta</hi> when he saw what was to be done, fell a trembling, and looking most wretchedly, which Mr. <hi>White</hi> perceiving, ask'd him what was the matter? The man replied, he was afraid if the <hi>Coromocon</hi> should come to know it, he must certainly lose his head. Mr. <hi>White</hi> calling him a parcel of foul names, ask'd how he durst pretend to scruple any thing he bad him do; but withal told him he needed not fear, that Paper was not to be shown to any body in this Country, but was to be sent to <hi>Europe,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Okonta</hi> and <hi>Escrivan</hi> went on with their work; and the Commission being thus finished, and the Names of the <hi>Oyea,</hi> and also the <hi>Coromocon</hi> (except Mr. <hi>Burnebys,</hi> for he had not been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to affix his Seal, nor did Mr. <hi>White</hi> think fit he should know of it) written by the same <hi>Escrivan</hi> in the <hi>Syam</hi> Language, close to each mans respective Seal. Mr. <hi>White</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me and Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> to attest the <hi>English</hi> writing to be a true Copy of the Original Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in <hi>Syam,</hi> instead whereof, I underwrote these words. The <hi>Shabander Okonta</hi> in <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> hath this twenty ninth day of <hi>March,</hi> 1687. declared what is above written in the <hi>Syam</hi> Language to contain the true sense and meaning of the subjoyn'd <hi>English</hi> Writing, Witness our hands.</p>

               <p>The first of this month, Mr. <hi>White</hi> began his progress towards <hi>Nocklay,</hi> in company with the <hi>Oyea,</hi> and the <hi>Coromocon,</hi> and himself attended with Mr. <hi>Burneby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thredder,</hi> Don <hi>Joseph,</hi> and Captain <hi>Cropley</hi> in his <hi>Gambdia</hi> Boat, no man knowing his private design, but my self, who went with only Mr. <hi>Triggs</hi> in the <hi>Shabanders</hi> Pinnace, from whom I also concealed it, pretending only to heave the Lead now and then for my own curiosity: Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Cropley</hi> also had a Lead in the <hi>Shabanders</hi> Boat, which I put into his mind to carry, pretending according to Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> orders to me, that I thought't would be a good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to acquaint our selves with the Channels among the Islands, which few or no <hi>English</hi> men ever made it their business to search out, and might one time or other stand a man in some stead, if he should happen to fall into the Southward of <hi>Ilha Grande.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At four days end, I having cast my eye upon a very convenient place for the purpose, and giving Mr. <hi>White</hi> privately an account of it, he presently goes himself to view it, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the Barge, and then finding the inconvenience of so much company, on such a design, return'd to <hi>Mergen,</hi> and the next day being the fifth instant, after about two hours
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:207011:18"/>stay at his own house, he took his journey to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> where my time was taken up in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justing Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Accounts with the Merchants, he in the mean time prosecuting his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, of raising what Money possibly he could, as he had before projected.</p>
               <p>Now during our stay here, the Lading of so much Tin and Goods, and provisions on Board the <hi>Mergen</hi> Frigat at <hi>Mergen,</hi> it seems had not done so privately but the Natives and <hi>Moors</hi> had taken notice of it, it being unusual to ship so late in the year, when they could not expect to go to Sea. This had occasioned several Rumours, and conjectures among the people, and at length one of the <hi>Shabanders</hi> Spys brings him word that one <hi>Namtula</hi> a <hi>Moor,</hi> and Merchant in <hi>Tenassery</hi> had reported that this lading of the ship at this time of the year could never be for any good design, and 'twas ten to one if the <hi>Shabander</hi> had not a mind to pack up his Aules and be gone, when every body least thought of it. Mr. <hi>White</hi> to prevent the spreading of any such dangerous report, immediately sends for this Merchant, and in great passion taxt him with it, The man denyed it, but that would not do; Mr. <hi>White</hi> orders him to be first severely whipt with <hi>Rattans,</hi> and then clapt in Irons, and lead through the <hi>Buzzar</hi> into the Common Gaol, there to lie four days, most of the eminent Merchants in Town interceded for him, but could not prevail. This action created great animosity, and heart burnings amongst them; but Mr. <hi>White</hi> valued it not, thinking it the best way thus to stop all their mouths for the future.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth instant we went up to the hot Waters, and had good divertisement in the Natives Fishing and Hunting, though Mr. <hi>White</hi> had the best in screwing out of the <hi>Sereacons</hi> for the Garden Rents in that River, to the Amount of one hundred twenty six <hi>Cattees</hi> of Silver.</p>
               <p>The twenty third we returned to <hi>Mergen,</hi> where Captain <hi>Lesly</hi> arrived the same day, to Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s great satisfaction, for though he had ordered him to stay Cruising untill the first of <hi>May,</hi> and then go to <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> before he was to come hither, yet the <hi>Saint Johns Bengala</hi> news about <hi>English,</hi> had made him often wish <hi>Lesly</hi> here sooner.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Leslys</hi> arrival put all things upon the spur, there was no time to be lost. The <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> Frigat is presently unladen, unrigg'd, and ordered to go up to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> with the King of <hi>Syam</hi>'s Colours, as his ship (for Mr. <hi>White</hi> had been accustomed at the close of each years-Books, to charge her and the <hi>Phaulkon</hi> to the Kings account, and afterwards to call them his own again) but the <hi>Resolution</hi> and <hi>Robin</hi> Sloop, which were really the Kings, he thought properest for the Design he had in hand, and so called them his own, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them hence forward to wear <hi>English</hi> Colours in Harbour. <hi>Lesly</hi> brings news the <hi>Mary</hi> sloop was taken by Captain <hi>Batten</hi> out of <hi>Pullicherry</hi> Road, and carried to <hi>Madrass.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> write word of it, and remitt by him a Copy of a Protest, which they had sent to <hi>Madrass</hi> concerning her, what further private account <hi>Lesly</hi> gave Mr. <hi>White</hi> of the state of Affairs at the Coast, I know not, but he is now the chief man in favour, and Mr. <hi>White</hi> all in a flame to be gone, he now presently gives out to the <hi>Syammers,</hi> that he had received orders (which was no such thing) from Court to fit, and keep in a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling posture the best Frigat the King had, which he said was the <hi>Resolution,</hi> who was to wear <hi>English</hi> Colours, and wait the Kings pleasure, for her dispatch at an hours warning, whither and whensoever his Majesty pleased, and therefore required the <hi>Coromocon,</hi> to order with all expedition possible, a supply of whatsoever he should find necessary for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Victualling of her with Rice, Cattle, Hogs, or any other Provisions, that his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor could in so short a time get in readiness, and to that end he would give them out his <hi>Tarraes</hi> to take all manner of Provision wheresoever it could be found, at the Kings price. In this distraction, and hurry were all things. When</p>
               <p>On the twenty eighth of the month discoursing with me his over-land design, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, that nothing did so much prejudice his undertaking, as the great disappointment in missing his <hi>Moco</hi> ship, since if she should happen to return hither safe, she would fall into the hands of either the <hi>English,</hi> that would lie before the Port, or the <hi>Syammers,</hi> so that he should never be one farthing the better, for what she brought hither, unless he could have stayed upon the place until <hi>September</hi> had been over, nor yet could he have the satisfaction to know whether she had put a shoar the 20000 <hi>Ry.</hi> 8/8. as he had ordered at <hi>Pullicherry.</hi> I took upon me to tell him, that I did verily believe, and could not perswade my self to be of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, then that we should see ships here from <hi>Madrass</hi> before <hi>August.</hi> To which he replyed, himself fear'd it was too true, for Captain <hi>Lesly</hi> had given him a very unwelcome Account, how matters stood.</p>
               <p>At this word, he flew out and swore, But God damn him he cared not much, he would make fools of one hundred of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Captains, saying moreover to the same purpose as once before he had said, That if any of them did come hither, before he could get away, so long as they were civil, he would be civil to them, but if ever a Kings Captain, or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of them all should come a shoar and tell him, that he must go to <hi>Madrass,</hi> and should pretend a power to force him thither, he would be the man that would Pistol him upon the place, with his own hands, and wipe his Arse with his Kings Commission, when he had done, that he could soon find ways to dispatch them, and all that belonged to them, adding withal, what a Plague dost think I'm to be scar'd, with the sight of the Kings Flag at a Boats Bow? No, continued he, with an horrid Oath, I know better things, I look upon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:207011:18"/>the best Commission any man has, that comes out on the Companies concerns, no better than if I had stood by, and seen them that bring it, make it under a hedge: However, if I can get away, I will, and if I cannot, whose soevers lot it is to find me here, they shall find <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> the hottest place, that ever they came against in their lives, as simply as 'tis fortified, for I am resolved never to go to <hi>Madrass,</hi> if there come Ten Sail of Men of War to fetch me, and if it does come to that pass, that I am intercepted in my design, I'le defend the place as long as 'tis possible, with the Natives, and when I can hold it no longer, I'le burn it down, and go to <hi>Syam</hi> by the Light on't, and see who will fetch me thence.</p>
               <p>I then replying, Sir, I am heartily sorry to hear this, and I would fain hope, that you speak not as you mean; at this Mr. <hi>White</hi> was transported into a great passion, and said, <hi>God damn thee,</hi> I see nothing will work with thee; and since I see thou art still resolved to prefer hugging thy own fears and jealousies, before either thy own advantage, or any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to my Interest, and art so unwilling to stick by me, when I have most occasion for thee, e'n get thee down stairs out of my House, and never come near me more, but if ever I hear a word out of thy mouth about my business, <hi>By the Eternal God,</hi> I'le cut thy Tongue out.</p>
               <p>I immediately withdrew, and went down to my own Room, not thinking it convenient presently to go abroad, lest his Rage might transport him into a jealous conceit, that I was gone to prattle of his passionate humour, which though I thought, had it been in another place, I had been bound in duty to declare his threatning expressions in contempt of his Majesty of <hi>England</hi>'s Authority to some Magistrates, yet to speak of it to any body here, where himself was absolute, would be an indiscretion, little inferiour to Mr. <hi>Whites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I continued still in my Room, and went not up to Dinner, but about Three in the Afternoon being told that Mr. <hi>White</hi> had taken his rest, and was now in a calm posture. I sent my Christian Servant one <hi>Lazarus Gomez</hi> up to Mr. <hi>White,</hi> with this following Paper.</p>

                        <p>SIR, That this morning I happen'd by the unseasonable declaration of my opinion to hazard your displeasure; I can't but acknowledge a great indiscretion, but I hope you will not censure it an unpardonable presumption, at least if you please to call to mind that plainness and sincerity, which you have so often, not only expressed your self highly satisfied with, but charg'd me to continue in the whole course of your service; and if by the over officious discharge of my Duty, and observance of your repeated Injunctions, I have offended, I have the less reason to trouble you with any formal Apology, but since you are return'd from <hi>Tenassery,</hi> and your Affairs in the posture which your self propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have them in before I left you. I now humbly request the friendly performance of your promise, which was, that I should be at liberty to withdraw from your employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and live retir'd from all publick business. My reasons for this request I have so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and fully discours't you, that to repeat them now, would be altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: I make choice of this way of addressing my self to you, partly to avoid any further occasion of offence, and if possible, to procure a friendly parting, that so the World may not take notice of any jarrings, to the prejudice of either of us, but chiefly to assure you under my hand, That as I prefer my Allegiance to my Prince, and the Duty I owe my own Country to all private advantages, so no less a consideration, than a hazard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, could have made me, ever since Mr. <hi>Nodens</hi> arrival at this Port, so solicitous to have declin'd your service, but however you will do me but right, to believe that I shall, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my dismission, continue as true to your secrets, relating to these people as your self can desire, and as becomes one who hath been accustomed to delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in being justly esteemed.</p>

               <p>My Servant on his return told me the <hi>Shabander</hi> had read my Note, and would speak with me, when I came up to him, what says he, Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> then you have no mind to stay with me. Sir, I reply'd, if I have not, I hope you are satisfied in my reasons for it, why says he, you seem by the tenderness, and care of your Allegiance, to suspect that I shan't be gone, before a Man of <hi>War</hi> meets with me, well I will not go about to convince you of a mistake, as to your own Interest I find you to be in love with, but if you will needs go, I will not detain you, only I would have you make good the conclusive part of this your Paper; you know my Concerns, and your discoursing them, may do me a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness, but I have no reason to suspect you in that particular; you may come when you will for your Money, and you shall have it; nor will I forget my promise, or be worse than my word to you, though 'tis too late for you to go now to <hi>Bengala,</hi> I hope you'l come now and then, and see us. Yes Sir, said I, and serve you too, in any matter that I can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apparent prejudice to my self; you say very well, said the <hi>Shabander,</hi> and you shall not find me backward in any kindness I can do you: So he drank to me in a Glass of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I pledg'd him, and so took my leave. Before I was got down stairs, he called me again; says he, Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> Whither do you intend to remove?

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:207011:19"/>him come to me in the morning, and receive the Money I borrowed of him last Moneth, for I'le send him, and his Family up to <hi>Tenassary,</hi> but don't you tell him any thing of that, till I speak to him my self; not I Sir, quoth I, but if he removes to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> it will be a very good pretence for me to go along with him, under colour of going again to the hot Waters, for my healths sake: Ay, sayes Mr. <hi>White,</hi> so it will: Thus we parted immediately that Evening, removing all my things from Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> House, to Captain <hi>Cropeleys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day Captain <hi>Cropely</hi> going to attend the <hi>Shabander,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> paid him thirty Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, which, on occasion of paying for Mounsieur <hi>Caroons</hi> Cargo, <hi>Cropely</hi> had lent him, and then tells him he must forthwith remove his Family to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> pretending he did not know how soon Ships might arrive here, and if there should happen any disturbance in the Town, 'twould be inconvenient to have his Family here, who might be frighted, and it may be worse used. <hi>Cropely</hi> on his return told me what had passed, and that though he knew very well 'twas for another reason, and not the care of his Family, or their safety, that made Mr. <hi>White</hi> order him to remove them to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> yet he would do it, lest Mr. <hi>White</hi> should take occasion to do him some mischief if he stay'd, for he had told him, that if any Enemy came against the place, himself, if he could not maintain against them, would burn the Town down to the ground.</p>
               <p>This Evening <hi>Edward Tuttie</hi> came to see us, and told us the <hi>Shabander</hi> had ordered him, and his Family up to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> and had no more discretion, than to tell <hi>Cropely,</hi> that his business there, was to give the <hi>Shabander</hi> from time to time an Account how the <hi>Moors</hi> and Natives censured the preparations he was making to get the Ship <hi>Resolution</hi> into a sailing posture, and whether he could learn out of any of them, that they had any suspicion of his intentions to leave the place, or any thing else, that he thought might tend to the <hi>Shaban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> prejudice, not to sail of giving timely notices.</p>

               <p>The Ninth this Moneth, all the Soldiers and Seamen (except those employed on the Ship <hi>Resolution,</hi> and Sloop <hi>Robin</hi>) were disbanded and discharged, and the Soldiers the next day posted away to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> with promise of passage to <hi>Syam,</hi> at the Kings Charge, but when they came to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> they were there stopt, and not suffered either to proceed, or return, on pretence of waiting for the Kings order.</p>
               <p>This Moneth the Sloop <hi>Phaulkon</hi> returned from the <hi>Nicobarrs,</hi> and the <hi>Dons</hi> new ship from <hi>Pullicherry,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> would not entertain her, and both of them were immediately unrigg'd and sent up with the King of <hi>Syams</hi> Colours to <hi>Tenassery,</hi> though the latter far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Solemn promises to the contrary, or the <hi>Dons</hi> expectations.</p>
               <p>The Fourteenth this Moneth, the Ship <hi>Resolution</hi> being richly and deep laden, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (by computation) which Eighteen Moneths Provisions for Forty Men, weighed Anchor, and drove down (without any Sails to the yards) opposite to the great Fort, where she rode two dayes, but did not moor. After two days stay there, commonly every other Night, those on board according to order, tript silently the Anchor, and let the Ship drive as low as they thought convenient, it may 1/4 mile, more or less in a Night, alwayes pretending the next morning that the Ships Anchor came home, and would not ride her; this was practised, until by degrees the Ship had drove out of reach of the great Fort Guns, and down so near the <hi>Barr,</hi> that at any time in the Night, with the first of the Ebb she might drive over the <hi>Barr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day appointed (as Mr. <hi>Burneby</hi> afterwards declared for her going to hide among the Islands) was to have been the 26th of the Moneth; but it pleased God to disappoint Mr. <hi>White</hi> in the very height of his expectations; as to that project, by the coming up to Town on the 23d Instant, towards Evening, of an <hi>English</hi> Yawle, which brought news of an <hi>English</hi> Man of War, being arriv'd near the Port.</p>
               <p>This surprizing news put Mr. <hi>White</hi> upon his former resolves of defending the place, and accordingly he issues out his <hi>Tarraes</hi> to summon all the Men in the adjacent <hi>Aldeas</hi> from Fifteen to Fifty years, to repair immediately into <hi>Mergen,</hi> on penalty of incurring the King of <hi>Syams</hi> high displeasure for their neglect, to work upon the Fortifications, and Man the <hi>Giliars</hi> and <hi>Gallies,</hi> as occas<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Having the assistance of such vast numbers of Men, Mr. <hi>White</hi> himself attending the work on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of <hi>June,</hi> in the Night time, that Battery was finished in Three Days and Nights.</p>
               <p>On the 26th, Captain <hi>Anthony Weltden</hi> arrived over the <hi>Barr,</hi> and what past from that time, until the 14th of <hi>July,</hi> the day of fatal Catastrophe, of so many of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, will be best discovered by the distinct Narrative of his management of Affairs in that Expedition.
